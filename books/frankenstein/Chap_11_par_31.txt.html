<span class = 'sc03'>And on the morrow Justine died</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Elizabethâ€™s heart-rending eloquence
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
criminality of the saintly sufferer</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>My passionate and indignant
appeals were lost upon them</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>And when I received their cold answers
and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
avowal died away on my lips</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She
perished on the scaffold as a murderess</span>
