<span class = 'sc03'>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was

blame</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity</span>

has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, Greece had not been enslaved, CÃ¦sar would have spared his
country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed</span>
