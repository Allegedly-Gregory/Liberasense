<span class = 'sc07'>â€œI generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
secured by night from the view of man</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>One morning, however, finding
that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
the air</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
appeared dead, revive within me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Half surprised by the novelty of
these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Soft tears
again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me</span>
