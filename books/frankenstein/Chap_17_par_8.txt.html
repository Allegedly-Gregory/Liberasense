<span class = 'sc08'>â€œSafie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a
slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
the father of Safie, who married her</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>She instructed her daughter in
the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
followers of Muhammad</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The prospect of marrying a Christian and
remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
society was enchanting to her</span>
