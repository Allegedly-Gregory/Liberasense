<span class = 'sc07'>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Heavy misfortunes have befallen
us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Our circle will be
small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived</span>
