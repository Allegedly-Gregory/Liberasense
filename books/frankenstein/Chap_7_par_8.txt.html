<span class = 'sc02'>“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The
conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
confirmed the idea which she had conceived</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Accordingly, a few months
after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Poor girl</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
for vivacity</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature
to restore her gaiety</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The poor woman was very vacillating in her
repentance</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
brothers and sister</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Justine has just returned to us;
and I assure you I love her tenderly</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her
expression continually remind me of my dear aunt</span>
