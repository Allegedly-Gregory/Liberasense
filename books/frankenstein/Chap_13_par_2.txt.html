<span class = 'sc05'>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>All of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
thought</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
mighty friends</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What were rain and storm to me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>My mule was
brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
Montanvert</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
cares of life</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
solitary grandeur of the scene</span>
