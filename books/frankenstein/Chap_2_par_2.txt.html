<span class = 'sc05'>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
country</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,
the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
league from the city</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We resided principally in the latter, and the
lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It was my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I was
indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Henry
Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He was a boy of singular
talent and fancy</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
its own sake</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
of the infidels</span>
