<span class = 'sc07'>This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>If any being felt
emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a
hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the
whole kind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of
another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
is all that I can receive, and it shall content me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>It is true, we shall be
monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
attached to one another</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
harmless and free from the misery I now feel</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My creator, make me
happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Let me see that I
excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
request</span>
