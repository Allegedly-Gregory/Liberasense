<span class = 'sc04'>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
where the corpse of my beloved lay</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>There were women weeping around; I
hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
cause</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The death
of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
feet</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I started
up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed</span>
