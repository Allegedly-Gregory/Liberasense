<span class = 'sc05'>â€œAutumn passed thus</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Yet I did
not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
conformation for the endurance of cold than heat</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But my chief
delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
towards the cottagers</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Their happiness was not decreased by the
absence of summer</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>They loved and sympathised with one another; and
their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The more I saw of them, the
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I dared not think that they would turn them from
me with disdain and horror</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
little food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
believe myself utterly unworthy of it</span>
