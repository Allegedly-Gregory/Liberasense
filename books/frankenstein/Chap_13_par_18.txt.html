<span class = 'sc05'>As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>My heart

various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
his tale</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my

rock</span>

his tale</span>
