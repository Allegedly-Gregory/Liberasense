<span class = 'sc03'>I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
of offering any reply</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>To me
the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
dismay</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over me and my devoted family</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Could I enter into a festival
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
ground</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
which I expected peace</span>
