<span class = 'sc05'>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
February</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
north at the expiration of another month</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>In this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
this tour about the end of July</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I packed up my chemical instruments and
the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland</span>
