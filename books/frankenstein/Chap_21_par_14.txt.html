<span class = 'sc05'>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
country</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>It had
been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s
sedulous attention</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
farewell</span>
