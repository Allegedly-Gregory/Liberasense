<span class = 'sc04'>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved my friend, I recovered</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I remember the first time I became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It was
a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion</span>
