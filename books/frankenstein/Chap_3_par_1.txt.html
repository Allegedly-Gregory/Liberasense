When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I had
hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country</span>

departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery</span>
