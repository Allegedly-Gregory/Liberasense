searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger</span>

this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
towards the setting sun</span>

place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
