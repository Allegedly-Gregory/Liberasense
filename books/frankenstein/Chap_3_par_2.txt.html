<span class = 'sc03'>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
in the greatest danger</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>During her illness many arguments had been urged to
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>She had at first
yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She
attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
imprudence were fatal to her preserver</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>On the third day my mother
sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>On her
deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
her</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“My
children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were
placed on the prospect of your union</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This expectation will now be the
consolation of your father</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
my younger children</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy
and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>But these are
not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
