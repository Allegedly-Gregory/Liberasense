<span class = 'sc03'>I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
increase my misery</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Remember, thou hast made
me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
joints more supple</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But I will not be tempted to set myself in
opposition to thee</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
the which thou owest me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Remember that I am thy creature;
I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
drivest from joy for no misdeed</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
alone am irrevocably excluded</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous</span>
