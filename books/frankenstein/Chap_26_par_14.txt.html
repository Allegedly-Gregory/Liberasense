<span class = 'sc04'>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>However, it was
hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I hired men
to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
mental torment in bodily exercise</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But the overflowing misery I now felt,
and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
exertion</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
to every gloomy idea that arose</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day
before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
Tears streamed from my eyes</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
then been observed by Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
a great and sudden change</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>A fiend had
snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
man</span>
