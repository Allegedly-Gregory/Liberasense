<span class = 'sc07'>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my
convalescence</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
concerning the wretch I had created</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I had a persuasion that I should be
supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But,
besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
his breast</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
from me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
relieved the burden of my mysterious woe</span>
