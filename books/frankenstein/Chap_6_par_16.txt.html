<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc04'>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I walked with a
quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I dreaded to
behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, I darted up towards my own room</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My hand was already on the
lock of the door before I recollected myself</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I then paused, and a
cold shivering came over me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I threw the door forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I stepped
fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
from its hideous guest</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I could hardly believe that so great a good
fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval</span>
