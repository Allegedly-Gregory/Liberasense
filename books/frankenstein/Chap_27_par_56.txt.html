<span class = 'sc07'>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>We were
in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The ice cracked
behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
free</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
loud and long-continued</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the tumult</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“They shout,” I said, “because they
will soon return to England</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
