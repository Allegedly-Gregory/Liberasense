<span class = 'sc05'>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
Clerval</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He came</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Alas, how great was the contrast between us</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He
was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
day</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
the appearances of the sky</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>“This is what it is to live,” he cried;
“now I enjoy existence</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
you desponding and sorrowful</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
sunrise reflected in the Rhine</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>And you, my friend, would be far more
amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I, a
miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment</span>
