<span class = 'sc05'>The season of the assizes approached</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I had already been three months
in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
town where the court was held</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Kirwin charged himself with every
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was spared
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
brought before the court that decides on life and death</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The grand
jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
after my removal I was liberated from prison</span>
