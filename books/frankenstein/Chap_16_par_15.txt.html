<span class = 'sc08'>â€œThese wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Was
man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
vicious and base</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
godlike</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>For a long time I
could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
loathing</span>
