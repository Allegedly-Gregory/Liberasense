<span class = 'sc05'>I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river
forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
overhangs it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>This
valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
more ruined castles and fertile fields</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Immense glaciers approached
the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Mont Blanc, the supreme and
magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley</span>
