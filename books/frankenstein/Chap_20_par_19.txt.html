<span class = 'sc05'>His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
the horizon when he departed</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy, and my steps slow</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The labour of winding among the
little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences
of the day had produced</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Night was far advanced when I came to the
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
thoughts within me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
exclaimed, “Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
