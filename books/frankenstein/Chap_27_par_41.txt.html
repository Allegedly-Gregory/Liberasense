<span class = 'sc05'>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>You will not hear of my
destruction, and you will anxiously await my return</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Years will pass, and
you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My
beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But you have a husband
and lovely children; you may be happy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Heaven bless you and make you so</span>
