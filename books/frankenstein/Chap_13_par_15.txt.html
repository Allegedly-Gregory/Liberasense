<span class = 'sc05'>“How can I move thee</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
compassion</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>You, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
who owe me nothing</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>They spurn and hate me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The desert mountains and
dreary glaciers are my refuge</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I have wandered here many days; the
caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
only one which man does not grudge</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>These bleak skies I hail, for they
are kinder to me than your fellow beings</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>If the multitude of mankind
knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
my destruction</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Shall I not then hate them who abhor me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I will keep
no terms with my enemies</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Let your compassion be
moved, and do not disdain me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Listen to my tale; when you have heard
that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
But hear me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Listen
to me, Frankenstein</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Oh, praise the
eternal justice of man</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
