<span class = 'sc04'>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But my plan was unsettled,
and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
what path I should pursue</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>As night approached I found myself at the
entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
reposed</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
graves</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
mourner</span>
