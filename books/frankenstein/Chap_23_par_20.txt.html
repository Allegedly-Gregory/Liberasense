<span class = 'sc06'>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
loved and miserable in the separation</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When it became noon, and the
sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
sleep</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The sleep
into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality</span>
