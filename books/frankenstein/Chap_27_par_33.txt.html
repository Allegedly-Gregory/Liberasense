<span class = 'sc05'>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
tale that ever imagination formed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My thoughts and every feeling of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I wish to soothe
him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
every hope of consolation, to live</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Oh, no</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The only joy that he can
now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
death</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
remote world</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth</span>
