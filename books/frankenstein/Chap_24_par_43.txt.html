<span class = 'sc03'>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
melancholy that nothing could dissipate</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The image of Clerval was
for ever before me, ghastly and murdered</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>More than once the agitation
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
relapse</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
drawing to a close</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
sink to rest</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins</span>
