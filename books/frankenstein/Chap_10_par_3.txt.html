<span class = 'sc03'>â€œYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>But
that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>What would be
your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And how, Victor, can
I relate our misfortune</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
son</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings</span>
