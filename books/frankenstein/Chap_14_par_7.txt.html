<span class = 'sc06'>â€œIt was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
embers when they were nearly extinguished</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>When night came again I
found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found
some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I
tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
the live embers</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I found that the berries were spoiled by this
operation, and the nuts and roots much improved</span>
