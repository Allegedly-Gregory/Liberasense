<span class = 'sc02'>â€œWhen night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was like a wild beast that had broken
the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
through the wood with a stag-like swiftness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>What a miserable
night I passed</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
burst forth amidst the universal stillness</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>All, save I, were at rest
or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
the ruin</span>
