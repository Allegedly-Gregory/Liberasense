sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
its miseries for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>At length I wandered towards these mountains,
and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
passion which you alone can gratify</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>We may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I am alone and miserable; man
will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me</span>

and have the same defects</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>This being you must create</span>
