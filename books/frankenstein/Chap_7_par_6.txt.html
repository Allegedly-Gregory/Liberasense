<span class = 'sc05'>“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so
frank-hearted and happy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
which she had at first intended</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This benefit was fully repaid;
Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not
mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>She
thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her</span>
