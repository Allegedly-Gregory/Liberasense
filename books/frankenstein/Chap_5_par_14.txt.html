<span class = 'sc04'>My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
occupation</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
succeeded</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>
Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Sometimes I grew alarmed at
the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
both of these when my creation should be complete</span>
