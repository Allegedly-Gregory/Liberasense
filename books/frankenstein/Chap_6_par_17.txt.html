<span class = 'sc05'>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
but I was unable to contain myself</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It was not joy only that possessed
me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
beat rapidly</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud</span>

Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him</span>
