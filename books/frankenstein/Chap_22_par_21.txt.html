<span class = 'sc02'>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and

mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
were shut to the horror of my proceedings</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But now I went to it in
cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands</span>
