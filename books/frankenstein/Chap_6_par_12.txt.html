<span class = 'sc08'>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back
to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
to my recollection</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
calm and serene joy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
manner, and we walked towards my college</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Clerval continued talking for
some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
permitted to come to Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“You may easily believe,” said
he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch
schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>’ But his
affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
knowledge</span>
