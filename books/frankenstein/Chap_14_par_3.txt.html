<span class = 'sc08'>â€œSoon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
pleasure</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>[The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It moved slowly,
but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>No distinct
ideas occupied my mind; all was confused</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I felt light, and hunger,
and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could
distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
pleasure</span>
