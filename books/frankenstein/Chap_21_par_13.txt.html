<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc02'>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
which filled me with fear and agitation</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>During my absence I should
leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
departure</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
would he not accompany me to England</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This imagination was dreadful in
itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
this might happen</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>But through the whole period during which I was the
slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
machinations</span>
