<span class = 'sc07'>“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Soon
after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which I had taken from your laboratory</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>At first I had
neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, I began to study them with diligence</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>It was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>You
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
occurrences</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>You doubtless recollect these papers</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Here they are</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I sickened as I read</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>‘Hateful
day when I received life</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>’ I exclaimed in agony</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>‘Accursed creator</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
disgust</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
very resemblance</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>’</span>
