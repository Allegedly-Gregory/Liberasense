<span class = 'sc07'>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He
endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
which he valued</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He reminds me how often the same accidents have
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Even the sailors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
resolutions of man</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>These feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
caused by this despair</span>
