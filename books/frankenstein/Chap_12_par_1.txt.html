Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
and fear</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Justine died, she rested, and I was alive</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The blood flowed
freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
heart which nothing could remove</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
behind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
beings</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
such as no language can describe</span>
