<span class = 'sc06'>â€œMy travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was
late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
human being</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh,
earth</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A few incidents
now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
often wandered wide from my path</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>The agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings</span>
