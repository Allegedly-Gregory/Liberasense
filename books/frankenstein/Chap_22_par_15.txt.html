<span class = 'sc05'>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Andrew’s, and
along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
alone</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper</span>
