<span class = 'sc01'>â€œFelix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
court</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>After many fruitless attempts to gain
admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the

her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard</span>
