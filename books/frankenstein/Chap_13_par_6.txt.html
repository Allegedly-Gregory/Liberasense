<span class = 'sc06'>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>For some
time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A mist covered
both that and the surrounding mountains</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The surface is very
uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The field of ice is almost a
league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>From the side where I
now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I remained in a recess
of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Their icy and glittering
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
away from the joys of life</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
