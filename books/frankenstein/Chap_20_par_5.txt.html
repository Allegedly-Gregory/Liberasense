<span class = 'sc03'>“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead
of threatening, I am content to reason with you</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I am malicious because I
am miserable</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>You, my creator,
would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I
should pity man more than he pities me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>You would not call it murder if you
could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
work of your own hands</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Shall I respect man when he condemns me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Let him
live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would
bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance</span>

But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
union</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>I will
revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and
chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
inextinguishable hatred</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor
finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
your birth</span>
