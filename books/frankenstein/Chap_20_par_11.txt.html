<span class = 'sc05'>“How inconstant are your feelings</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But a moment ago you were moved by
my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that
with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and
dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>My evil passions
will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My life will flow quietly
away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker</span>
