<span class = 'sc08'>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
soon gave place to delight and rapture</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>After so much time spent in
painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
most gratifying consummation of my toils</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But this discovery was so
great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
of the world was now within my grasp</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Not that, like a magic scene, it
all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
accomplished</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light</span>
