<span class = 'sc06'>“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
No sympathy may I ever find</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When I first sought it, it was the love of
virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that I wished to be participated</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Once
I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I was
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But now crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>No guilt, no mischief, no
malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When I run over the
frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Yet even that enemy of God and man
had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone</span>
