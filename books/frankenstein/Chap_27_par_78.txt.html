<span class = 'sc07'>â€œBut it is true that I am a wretch</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I have murdered the lovely and
the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I have
devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
irremediable ruin</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>There he lies, white and cold in death</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You hate me, but
your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I look on the
hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more</span>
