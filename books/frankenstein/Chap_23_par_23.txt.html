<span class = 'sc05'>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d√¶mon</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I had
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
clearly</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I had resolved in
my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
conclusion</span>
