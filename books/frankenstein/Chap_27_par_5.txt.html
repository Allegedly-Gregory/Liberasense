<span class = 'sc02'>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
rage and despair</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I knelt on the grass
and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the
sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>For this purpose I will
preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Let the cursed
and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
torments me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
