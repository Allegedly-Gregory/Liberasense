<span class = 'sc04'>“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>You are
forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
is necessary to calm our apprehensions</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>For a long time I have thought
that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I have
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
perform it myself</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I figure to myself that the task of attending on
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
your poor cousin</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed
you are getting better</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
intelligence soon in your own handwriting</span>
