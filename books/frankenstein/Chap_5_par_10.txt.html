<span class = 'sc07'>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
one pursuit</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>And the
same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
not seen for so long a time</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
well remembered the words of my father:  “I know that while you are
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
hear regularly from you</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You must pardon me if I regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
are equally neglected</span>
