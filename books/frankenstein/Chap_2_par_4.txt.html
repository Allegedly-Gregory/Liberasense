<span class = 'sc08'>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
indiscriminately</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I confess that neither the structure of languages,
nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
possessed attractions for me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It was the secrets of heaven and earth
that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world</span>
