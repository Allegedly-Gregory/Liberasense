<span class = 'sc07'>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
was reserved for vengeance</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The laughter died away, when a well-known
and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>You have
determined to live, and I am satisfied</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
