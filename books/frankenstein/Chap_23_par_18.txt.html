<span class = 'sc05'>All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I burned with rage to
pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Why had I not
followed him and closed with him in mortal strife</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But I had suffered him
to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I shuddered
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on
your wedding-night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>_” That, then, was the period fixed for the
fulfilment of my destiny</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
extinguish his malice</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
before my enemy without a bitter struggle</span>
