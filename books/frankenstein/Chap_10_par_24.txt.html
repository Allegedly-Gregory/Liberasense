<span class = 'sc03'>My journey was very melancholy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I
drew near my native town, I slackened my progress</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I could hardly sustain
the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I passed through
scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
How altered every thing might be during that time</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>One sudden and
desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Fear overcame me; I
dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
although I was unable to define them</span>
