<span class = 'sc05'>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
electricity</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>On this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me</span>

All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
be known</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
real knowledge</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration</span>
