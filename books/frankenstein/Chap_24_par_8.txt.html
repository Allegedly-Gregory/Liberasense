<span class = 'sc06'>Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into
the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
effect the sight of it would produce upon me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>This idea was probably
suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
murder had been described</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
and several other persons, to the inn</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I could not help being struck by the
strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had
inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
tranquil as to the consequences of the affair</span>
