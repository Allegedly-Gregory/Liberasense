Agatha entered</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Who can describe their horror and consternation on
beholding me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
friend, rushed out of the cottage</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Felix darted forward, and with
supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
with a stick</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
the antelope</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
I refrained</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel</span>
