<span class = 'sc02'>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
half open and my cheeks livid like those in death</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was overcome by gloom
and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to

considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been</span>

thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Kirwin entered</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>

mine and addressed me in French,</span>
