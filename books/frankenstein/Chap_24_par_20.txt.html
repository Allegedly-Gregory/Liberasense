<span class = 'sc05'>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Kirwin had

<span class = 'sc07'>He had caused the best room in the prison
to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
had provided a physician and a nurse</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It is true, he seldom came to
see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
miserable ravings of a murderer</span>

that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
intervals</span>
