<span class = 'sc06'>â€œThe winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
place since I awoke into life</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My attention at this time was solely
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
protectors</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
beheld me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
be tolerated by my younger protectors</span>
