<span class = 'sc07'>About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oâ€™clock,
they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
for port</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
and his companions followed him at some distance</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>As he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length on the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>His companions came up to assist him, and by the
light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
who was to all appearance dead</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Their first supposition was that it was the
corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
that the body was not then cold</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
to life</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
years of age</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck</span>
