<span class = 'sc05'>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He mentioned the
beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
where he resided</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,
although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places</span>
