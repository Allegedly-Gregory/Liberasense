<span class = 'sc07'>For a long time I was their only care</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>My mother had much desired to have a
daughter, but I continued their single offspring</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When I was about five
years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they
passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Their benevolent
disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>This, to my
mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
afflicted</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
shape</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
accompanied by me, visited this abode</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She found a peasant and his wife,
hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
five hungry babes</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
above all the rest</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She appeared of a different stock</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The four others were
dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Her
hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Her brow was
clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features</span>
