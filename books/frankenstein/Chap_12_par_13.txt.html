<p class='sc02'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I afterwards
hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
injury on these rugged roads</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The weather was fine; it was about the
middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of Arve</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The immense mountains and precipices that overhung
me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
Omnipotenceâ€”and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
displayed in their most terrific guise</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Still, as I ascended higher,
the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But it was
augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and
shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
earth, the habitations of another race of beings</span>
