<span class = 'sc05'>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I know not whether the
fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
when I first saw the ocean he was but one dayâ€™s journey in advance, and
I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>With new
courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet on the seashore</span>

had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance</span>

food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts</span>
