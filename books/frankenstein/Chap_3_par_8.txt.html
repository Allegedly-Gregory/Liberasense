<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc03'>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasure—I was now alone</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>In the university whither I was going I
must form my own friends and be my own protector</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself
totally unfitted for the company of strangers</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Such were my reflections as
I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I had often, when at home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
repent</span>
