<span class = 'sc02'>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But I did not
feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
scenes of evil and despair</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I considered the being whom I had cast
among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
to destroy all that was dear to me</span>
