<span class = 'sc05'>â€œBut how was I to direct myself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I knew that I must travel in a
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
only guide</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
did not despair</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>From you only could I hope for succour, although
towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Unfeeling,
heartless creator</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
any other being that wore the human form</span>
