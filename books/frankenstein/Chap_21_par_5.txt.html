<span class = 'sc08'>“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
stay of my declining years</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>You were attached to each other from your
earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
tastes, entirely suited to one another</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But so blind is the experience of
man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
entirely destroyed it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
wish that she might become your wife</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Nay, you may have met with another
whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
to feel</span>
