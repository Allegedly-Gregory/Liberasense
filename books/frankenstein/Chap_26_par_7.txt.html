<span class = 'sc05'>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
my adversary</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
scream</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>As I
heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This
state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
into the room</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
