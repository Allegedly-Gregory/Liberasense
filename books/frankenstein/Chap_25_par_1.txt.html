The voyage came to an end</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We landed, and proceeded to Paris</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I soon

could continue my journey</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My fatherâ€™s care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He wished me to
seek amusement in society</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I abhorred the face of man</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Oh, not

to share their intercourse</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I had unchained an enemy among them whose
joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans</span>

would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me</span>
