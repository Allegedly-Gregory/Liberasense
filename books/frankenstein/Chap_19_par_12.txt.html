<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc02'>â€œI continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
utter and stupid despair</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My protectors had departed and had broken
the only link that held me to the world</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>For the first time the
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
bent my mind towards injury and death</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>When I thought of my friends,
of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>But again when I reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>As
night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations</span>
