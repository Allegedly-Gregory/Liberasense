<span class = 'sc04'>â€œYou have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
But this is false reasoning</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I confess to you, my friend, that I love
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
friend and companion</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Even now
I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I, who
have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Ah</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Victor, be assured
that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
made miserable by this supposition</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Be happy, my friend; and if you
obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity</span>
