<span class = 'sc06'>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
but I sailed away from them</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I felt as if I was about the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
fellow creatures</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
as it sank and then sailed away from the spot</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The sky became clouded, but
the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
rising</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Clouds hid the
moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its
keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I
slept soundly</span>
