<span class = 'sc05'>â€œThe words induced me to turn towards myself</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
unsullied descent united with riches</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>A man might be respected with
only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And what was I</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Of
my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
of the same nature as man</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I was more agile than they and could
subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>When I looked
around I saw and heard of none like me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Was I, then, a monster, a blot
upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
