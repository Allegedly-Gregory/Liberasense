<span class = 'sc05'>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He bounded over the
crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I was
troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I
perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
that it was the wretch whom I had created</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I trembled with rage and
horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
mortal combat</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>But I scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt</span>
