cure the wound which I had received</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The ball had entered my shoulder,
and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate I had no means of extracting it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My sufferings were augmented
also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
infliction</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
endured</span>
