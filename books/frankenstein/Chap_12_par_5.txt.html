<span class = 'sc05'>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>This change was
particularly agreeable to me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The shutting of the gates regularly at
ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
to me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I was now free</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Often, after the rest of the family had
retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
water</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,
I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But I was restrained,
when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I thought also of my
father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
among them</span>
