<span class = 'sc05'>This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I struggled vainly for
firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>At that
moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I had not a moment
to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the
time</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Save and protect me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>You and your family are the friends whom I
seek</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Do not you desert me in the hour of trial</span>
