<span class = 'sc08'>“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
place since you left us</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they
never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but happy, kind faces around me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Since you left us, but one
change has taken place in our little household</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Do you remember on
what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Probably you do not;
I will relate her history, therefore in a few words</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Madame Moritz,
her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
third</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
after the death of M</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Moritz, treated her very ill</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>My aunt observed
this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at our house</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Hence there is less
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being</span>
