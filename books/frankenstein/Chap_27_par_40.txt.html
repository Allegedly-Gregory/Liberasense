I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The brave fellows whom I
have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
none to bestow</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>There is something terribly appalling in our
situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Yet it is
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
through me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause</span>
