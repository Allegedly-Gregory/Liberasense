<span class = 'sc04'>I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If
I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My vices
are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I shall feel
the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
existence and events from which I am now excluded</span>
