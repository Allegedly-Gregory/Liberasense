<span class = 'sc05'>â€œAs I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
breast</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>In spite
of my malignity, it softened and attracted me</span>

gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
expressive of disgust and affright</span>
