<span class = 'sc07'>Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He
came to the university with the design of making himself complete
master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for himself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
the same studies</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
amusement</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
repaid my labours</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
any other country</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>When you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,â€”in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>How
different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome</span>
