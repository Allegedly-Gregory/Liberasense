<span class = 'sc05'>We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
as we glided down the stream</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I lay at the
bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He felt as if he had
been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes
of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The
mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
half hid in the recess of the mountain</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
our own country</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
