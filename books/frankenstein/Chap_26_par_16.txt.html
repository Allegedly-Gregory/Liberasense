<span class = 'sc05'>I arrived at Geneva</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
under the tidings that I bore</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I see him now, excellent and venerable old
man</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delightâ€”his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Cursed, cursed
be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
in wretchedness</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms</span>
