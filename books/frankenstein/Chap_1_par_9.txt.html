<span class = 'sc08'>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She was
not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Her mother was a
German and had died on giving her birth</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The infant had been placed with
these good people to nurse: they were better off then</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They had not been
long married, and their eldest child was but just born</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The father of their
charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
of Italyâ€”one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
himself to obtain the liberty of his country</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He became the victim of its
weakness</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria
was not known</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
a beggar</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles</span>
