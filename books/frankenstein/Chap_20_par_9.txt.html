us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My food is not
that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My companion will
be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
man and will ripen our food</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The picture I present to you is peaceful
and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
wantonness of power and cruelty</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Pitiless as you have been towards me,
I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire</span>
