<span class = 'sc07'>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
journey</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Then again the
kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief
and indulging in all the misery of reflection</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Then I spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair</span>
