<span class = 'sc02'>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I
myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your
vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
at the sight</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
the direction of your ship</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I had determined, if you were going southwards,
still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
purpose</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
my enemy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But your direction was northwards</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>You took me on board when my
vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied
hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled</span>
