<span class = 'sc08'>“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
at sunset I arrived at a village</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>How miraculous did this appear</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>One
of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>
The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
beheld in the village</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
dared not enter it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>No wood, however,
was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain</span>
