<span class = 'sc04'>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
of life even in the excess of misery</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I constructed another sail with a
part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It had a
wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
the traces of cultivation</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>As I was in a state of
extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
where I could most easily procure nourishment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Fortunately I had money with
me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
escape</span>
