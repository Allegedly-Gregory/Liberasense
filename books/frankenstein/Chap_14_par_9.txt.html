<span class = 'sc06'>“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This
was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
curiosity</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Finding the door open, I entered</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>An old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He turned on
hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>His appearance, different from any I had ever
before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But I was enchanted
by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell
after their sufferings in the lake of fire</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I greedily devoured the
remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Then, overcome by
fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep</span>
