<span class = 'sc08'>â€œThe pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
conclusions</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I had certainly acted imprudently</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It was apparent that
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I
ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
been  prepared for my approach</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But I did not believe my errors to be
irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
party</span>
