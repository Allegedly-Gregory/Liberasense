<span class = 'sc05'>â€œI can hardly describe to you the effect of these books</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>In
the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
were for ever alive in my own bosom</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>But I thought Werter himself a
more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The disquisitions upon
death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I did not
pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
understanding it</span>
