<span class = 'sc05'>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support
me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
of the horizon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the

and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversaryâ€™s gibe,
to meet and grapple with him</span>
