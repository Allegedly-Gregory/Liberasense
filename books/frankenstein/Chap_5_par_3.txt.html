<span class = 'sc07'>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
natural philosophy which relate to physiology</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Unless I had been
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>To examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I became
acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
food for the worm</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My attention was fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon meâ€”a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret</span>
