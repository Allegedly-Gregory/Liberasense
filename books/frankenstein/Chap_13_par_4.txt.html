<span class = 'sc03'>  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
       We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
       Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
  It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,
       The path of its departure still is free</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
       Nought may endure but mutability</span>
