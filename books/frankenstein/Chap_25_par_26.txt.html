<span class = 'sc08'>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
feelings when sunk in torpor</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She wept with me and for me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When reason
returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
resignation</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Ah</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
guilty there is no peace</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief</span>
