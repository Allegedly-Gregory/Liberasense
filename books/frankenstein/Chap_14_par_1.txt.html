â€œIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of
my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>By
degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
was obliged to shut my eyes</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
suppose, the light poured in upon me again</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I walked and, I believe,
descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The light
became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This was the
forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I slaked my thirst
at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep</span>
