<span class = 'sc07'>â€œOne day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been
left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
warmth I experienced from it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>How strange,
I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
composed of wood</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
and would not burn</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was pained at this and sat still watching the
operation of the fire</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
dried and itself became inflamed</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I reflected on this, and by touching
the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>When night came on and brought sleep with
it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank
into sleep</span>
