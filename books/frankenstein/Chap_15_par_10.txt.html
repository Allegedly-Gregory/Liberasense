<span class = 'sc05'>â€œI spent the winter in this manner</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The old man, I could perceive,
often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
he called them, to cast off their melancholy</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
even upon me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was not thus
with Felix</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
friends</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
man</span>
