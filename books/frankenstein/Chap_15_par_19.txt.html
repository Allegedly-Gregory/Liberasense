aspect of the earth</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Men who before this change seemed to have been

for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
unwholesome</span>

nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy</span>
