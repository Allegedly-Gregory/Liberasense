<span class = 'sc04'>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my present undertaking</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The latter method of obtaining
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
loathsome task in my fatherâ€™s house while in habits of familiar
intercourse with those I loved</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I knew that a thousand fearful
accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
thrill all connected with me with horror</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I was aware also that I
should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
employed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
restored to my family in peace and happiness</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My promise fulfilled,
the monster would depart for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
slavery for ever</span>
