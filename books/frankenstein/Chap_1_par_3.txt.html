<span class = 'sc05'>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Overjoyed at this discovery,
he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
Reuss</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him</span>

had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
merchantâ€™s house</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion</span>
