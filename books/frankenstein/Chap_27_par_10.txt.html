<span class = 'sc05'>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
have ever followed in his track</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Sometimes the peasants, scared by
this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
left some mark to guide me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The snows descended on my head, and I saw
the print of his huge step on the white plain</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>To you first entering
on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have felt and still feel</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Cold, want, and fatigue were the
least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The
fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
invoked to aid me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
few drops that revived me, and vanish</span>
