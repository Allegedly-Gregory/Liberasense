<span class = 'sc06'>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>We were told this when young, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
place</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But
as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
case</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Tell me, dearest Victor</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another</span>
