<span class = 'sc04'>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
triumphed over my selfish despair</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It was necessary that I should
return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the
mockery of a soul still more monstrous</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My father still desired to
delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
journey, for I was a shattered wreckâ€”the shadow of a human being</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My
strength was gone</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
preyed upon my wasted frame</span>
