<span class = 'sc07'>â€œBy degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I found that
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I perceived that the words
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But I was baffled in
every attempt I made for this purpose</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Their pronunciation was quick, and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
mystery of their reference</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>By great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
_wood</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>_ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The youth
and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
one, which was _father</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>_ The girl was called _sister_ or
_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I cannot
describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of
these sounds and was able to pronounce them</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I distinguished several other
words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
dearest, unhappy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>_</span>
