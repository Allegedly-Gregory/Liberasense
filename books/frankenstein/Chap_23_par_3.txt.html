<span class = 'sc02'>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
the light of the moon the d√¶mon at the casement</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>A ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
which he had allotted to me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfilment of my promise</span>
