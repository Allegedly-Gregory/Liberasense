<span class = 'sc02'>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
the depths of despair</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I left the house, the horrid scene of the last
night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I
desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>If I returned, it was to
be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
dæmon whom I had myself created</span>
