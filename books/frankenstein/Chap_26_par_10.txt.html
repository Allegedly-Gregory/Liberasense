<span class = 'sc02'>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I rushed towards
the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
plunged into the lake</span>
