<span class = 'sc03'>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
mountain</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It is a scene terrifically desolate</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In a thousand spots
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
other trees</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene</span>

I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
received from the objects around me</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>If our impulses were confined to hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
convey to us</span>
