<span class = 'sc02'>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Despair</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Who dared talk of that</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
deep and bitter agony</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Justine started</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When
she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
