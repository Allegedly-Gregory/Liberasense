<span class = 'sc08'>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
memory of the past and the anticipation of the future</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I was formed
for peaceful happiness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>During my youthful days discontent never
visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
elasticity to my spirits</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
I shall soon cease to beâ€”a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
pitiable to others and intolerable to myself</span>
