<span class = 'sc05'>And where does he now exist</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Is this gentle and lovely being lost
for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
life of its creator;â€”has this mind perished</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Does it now only exist
in my memory</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
consoles your unhappy friend</span>
