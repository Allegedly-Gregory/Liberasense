<span class = 'sc05'>From thence we proceeded to Oxford</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>As we entered this city, our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was here that Charles
I</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>had collected his forces</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>This city had remained faithful to him,
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
Parliament and liberty</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The spirit of elder days found a
dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>If these
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees</span>
