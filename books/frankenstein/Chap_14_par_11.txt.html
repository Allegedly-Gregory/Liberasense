<span class = 'sc06'>â€œHere, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
from the barbarity of man</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>As soon as morning dawned I crept from my
kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could
remain in the habitation I had found</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It was situated against the back
of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>One part was open, and by that I had
crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on
occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and
that was sufficient for me</span>
