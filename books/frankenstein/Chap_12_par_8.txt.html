<span class = 'sc02'>“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of
Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Yet I am
certainly unjust</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>For the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
it had been her own</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I could not consent to the death of any human
being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But she was innocent</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I know, I feel
she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of certain happiness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I feel as if I were walking on
the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>William and Justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
wretch</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
