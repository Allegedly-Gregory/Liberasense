<span class = 'sc07'>Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
my father thought it best to yield</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>We took our passage on board a vessel
bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
It was midnight</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
the dashing of the waves</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my
sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should
soon see Geneva</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I
repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
which he first lived</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly</span>
