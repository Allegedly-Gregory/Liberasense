<span class = 'sc05'>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of English history</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
themselves</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
field on which that patriot fell</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>For a moment my soul was elevated
from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
and the remembrancers</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
miserable self</span>
