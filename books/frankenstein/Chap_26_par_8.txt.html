<span class = 'sc08'>Great God</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Why did I not then expire</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Why am I here to relate the
destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She was
there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Everywhere I
turn I see the same figureâ€”her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
by the murderer on its bridal bier</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Could I behold this and live</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>For a moment
only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
