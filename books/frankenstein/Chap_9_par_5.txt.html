<span class = 'sc05'>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
Excellent friend</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden</span>
