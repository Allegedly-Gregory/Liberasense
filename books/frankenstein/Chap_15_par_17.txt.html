<span class = 'sc04'>â€œMy thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to
know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I thought
(foolish wretch</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
these deserving people</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix
flitted before me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I looked upon them as superior beings who would be
the arbiters of my future destiny</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I formed in my imagination a
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
afterwards their love</span>
