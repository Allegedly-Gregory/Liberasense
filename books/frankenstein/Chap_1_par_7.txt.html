<span class = 'sc05'>From Italy they visited Germany and France</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I, their eldest child, was born
at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I remained
for several years their only child</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Much as they were attached to each
other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
mine of love to bestow them upon me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My mother’s tender caresses and
my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
first recollections</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I was their plaything and their idol, and something
better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
their duties towards me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>With this deep consciousness of what they owed
towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
one train of enjoyment to me</span>
