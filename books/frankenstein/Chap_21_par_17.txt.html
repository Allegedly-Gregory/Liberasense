<span class = 'sc06'>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to
Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>During this
voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The course of the Rhine below Mainz
becomes much more picturesque</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The river descends rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>We saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This part of the Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated landscape</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>In one spot you view
rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
and populous towns occupy the scene</span>
