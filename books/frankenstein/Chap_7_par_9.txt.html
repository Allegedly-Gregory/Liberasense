<span class = 'sc08'>â€œI must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
William</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>When he
smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
health</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron
is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age</span>
