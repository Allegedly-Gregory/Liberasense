<span class = 'sc05'>“What do you mean</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>What do you demand of your captain</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Are you, then,
so easily turned from your design</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Did you not call this a glorious
expedition</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“And wherefore was it glorious</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Not because the way was
smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
these you were to brave and overcome</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>For this was it a glorious, for this
was it an honourable undertaking</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>You were hereafter to be hailed as the
benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>And now,
behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
firesides</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Be men, or be more than men</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This ice is not made of such stuff as your
hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
shall not</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
marked on your brows</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
