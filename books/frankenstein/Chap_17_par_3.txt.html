<span class = 'sc03'>â€œThe father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He was a
Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some
reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
Constantinople to join him</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He was tried and condemned to death</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The
injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation</span>
