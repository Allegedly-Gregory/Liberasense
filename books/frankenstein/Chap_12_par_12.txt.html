<span class = 'sc08'>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
sensations</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left
my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My wanderings were directed
towards the valley of Chamounix</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I had visited it frequently during my
boyhood</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes</span>
