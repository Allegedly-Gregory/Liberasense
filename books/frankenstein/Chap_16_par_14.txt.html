<span class = 'sc05'>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins
of Empires_</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He had chosen this
work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
Eastern authors</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history
and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
nations of the earth</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous
genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the
decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I heard
of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the
hapless fate of its original inhabitants</span>
