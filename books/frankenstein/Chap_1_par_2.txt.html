<span class = 'sc05'>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
refrain from relating them</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>One of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance</span>
