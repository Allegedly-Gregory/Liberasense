<span class = 'sc08'>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
his soul</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
fancy and passion</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity</span>
