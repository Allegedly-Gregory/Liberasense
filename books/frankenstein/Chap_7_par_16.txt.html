<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc05'>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>In doing this, I underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>When I was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He had also changed my apartment; for he
perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>But these cares of Clerval were made of
no avail when I visited the professors</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>M</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
had made in the sciences</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He soon perceived that I disliked the
subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What
could I do</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He meant to please, and he tormented me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply</span>
