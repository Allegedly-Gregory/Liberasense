<span class = 'sc08'>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>But a blight had

fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
my soul with anguish</span>
