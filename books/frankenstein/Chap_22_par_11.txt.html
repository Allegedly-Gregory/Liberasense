Cumberland and Westmorland</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I could now almost fancy myself among the
Swiss mountains</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me</span>

these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine</span>
