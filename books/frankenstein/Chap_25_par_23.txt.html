<span class = 'sc05'>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My letter was calm and
affectionate</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness
remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
you</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
and my endeavours for contentment</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
wonder that I survive what I have endured</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I will confide this tale of
misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But
until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This I most
earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
