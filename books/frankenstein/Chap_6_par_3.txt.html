<span class = 'sc03'>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>For this I had
deprived myself of rest and health</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>At length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
dreams</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
the streets of Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, I beheld the wretchâ€”the miserable monster whom I had
created</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>His jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He might have
spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I took refuge in the
courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I
had so miserably given life</span>
