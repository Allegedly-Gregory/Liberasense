<span class = 'sc01'>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I
escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my
wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She had been moved from the
posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
supposed her asleep</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held
in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
The murderous mark of the fiendâ€™s grasp was on her neck, and the
breath had ceased to issue from her lips</span>
