<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc06'>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
departure for Ingolstadt</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Beloved and venerable parent</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He still remained
to me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
mantel-piece</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s
desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
by the coffin of her dead father</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
sentiment of pity</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
tears flowed when I looked upon it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>While I was thus engaged, Ernest
entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“Ah</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I wish you
had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
delighted</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>—Poor
William</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>he was our darling and our pride</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
