<span class = 'sc06'>â€œOn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
filled up with wood</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In one of these was a small and almost
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The silver hair and benevolent
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
manners of the girl enticed my love</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He played a sweet mournful air
which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
at his feet</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
window, unable to bear these emotions</span>
