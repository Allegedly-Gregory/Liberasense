<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
found that the sun had already mounted considerably</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The wind was high, and
the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I found
that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
which I had embarked</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I
confess that I felt a few sensations of terror</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I had no compass with me
and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I might be driven into the
wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I had already
been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
sea; it was to be my grave</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>“Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your
task is already fulfilled</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
sanguinary and merciless passions</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>This idea plunged me into a reverie so
despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it</span>
