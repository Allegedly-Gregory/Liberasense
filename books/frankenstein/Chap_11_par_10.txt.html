<span class = 'sc02'>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who
was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
with his parents ever since and even long before his birth</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It may
therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
know of her character</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I am well acquainted with the accused</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I have lived
in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
two years</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
benevolent of human creatures</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She was
warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
most affectionate mother</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
on her perfect innocence</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She had no temptation for such an action; as to
the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
her</span>
