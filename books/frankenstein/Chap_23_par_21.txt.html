<span class = 'sc08'>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
join him</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
Indian enterprise</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
my society on him as I could spare</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He besought me, therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
southwards together</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days</span>
