<span class = 'sc07'>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
and anxious to gain experience and instruction</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The difference of
manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
instruction and amusement</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He was also pursuing an object he had long
had in view</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
European colonization and trade</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In Britain only could he further the
execution of his plan</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He was for ever busy, and the only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I tried to conceal this
as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
any care or bitter recollection</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I often refused to accompany him,
alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I now also
began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
on the head</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and my heart to palpitate</span>
