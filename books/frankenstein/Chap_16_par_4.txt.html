<span class = 'sc05'>â€œIt was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
veil</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Her voice was
musical but unlike that of either of my friends</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>On hearing this word,
Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Her
hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
a lovely pink</span>
