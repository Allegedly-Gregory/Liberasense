<span class = 'sc07'>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
with unremitting ardour</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realise</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>One secret which I alone
possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Who shall conceive
the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
clay</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
returned to my old habits</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
brought my work near to a conclusion</span>
