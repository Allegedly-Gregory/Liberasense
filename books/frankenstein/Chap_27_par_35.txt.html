<span class = 'sc08'>“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for
some great enterprise</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This sentiment of
the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
might be useful to my fellow creatures</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>When I reflected on the work I had
completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>But
this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>All my speculations and hopes
are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
chained in an eternal hell</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Even now I cannot
recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I trod
heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
of their effects</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am I sunk</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>My friend, if you had known me as I once
was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Despondency
rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
never, never again to rise</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
