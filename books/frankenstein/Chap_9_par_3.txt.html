<span class = 'sc02'>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I felt this
delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
friends</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My return had only been delayed so long, from an
unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
acquainted with any of its inhabitants</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The winter, however, was spent
cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness</span>
