<span class = 'sc05'>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
auditor</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
returned</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you
every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Who can follow an
animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
no man would venture to intrude</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
has wandered or what region he may now inhabit</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
