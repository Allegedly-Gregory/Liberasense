<span class = 'sc05'>You will find a happy, cheerful home and
friends who love you dearly</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Your father’s health is vigorous, and he
asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>How pleased you would
be to remark the improvement of our Ernest</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He is now sixteen and full
of activity and spirit</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter
into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
elder brother returns to us</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>My uncle is not pleased with the idea of
a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your
powers of application</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
lake</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected</span>
