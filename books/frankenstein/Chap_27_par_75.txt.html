<span class = 'sc03'>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
friend, indignation was rekindled within me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“Wretch</span>

“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
have made</span>

he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It is not pity that you
feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
from your power</span>
