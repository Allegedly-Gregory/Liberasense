<span class = 'sc08'>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,
therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
predilection for that science</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>When I was thirteen years of age we all went
on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the
weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In this house I
chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I opened it
with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>A new
light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
discovery to my father</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>My father looked carelessly at the title page of my
book and said, “Ah</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cornelius Agrippa</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>My dear Victor, do not waste
your time upon this; it is sad trash</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
