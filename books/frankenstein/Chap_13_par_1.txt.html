I spent the following day roaming through the valley</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I stood beside
the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
barricade the valley</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>They elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
grief, they subdued and tranquillised it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In some degree, also, they
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
last month</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
had contemplated during the day</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>They congregated round me; the
unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the cloudsâ€”they all
gathered round me and bade me be at peace</span>
