<span class = 'sc02'>“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
abhorred myself</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I
knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
disobey</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Yet when she died</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Nay, then I was not miserable</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Evil thenceforth became my good</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Urged thus far, I had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
chosen</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
passion</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>And now it is ended; there is my last victim</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
