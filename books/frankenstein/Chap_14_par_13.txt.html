<span class = 'sc07'>â€œBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
something should occur which might alter my determination</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It was
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Yet she was meanly dressed, a
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail, which was now partly filled with milk</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>As she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
countenance expressed a deeper despondence</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottage himself</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>She followed, and they disappeared</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Presently I saw
the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
house and sometimes in the yard</span>
