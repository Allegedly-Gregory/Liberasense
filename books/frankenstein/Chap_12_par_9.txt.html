<span class = 'sc03'>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I, not in deed,
but in effect, was the true murderer</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you
must calm yourself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>These events have affected me, God knows how
deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>There is an expression of
despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
tremble</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Dear Victor, banish these dark passions</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Remember the
friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Have we lost
the power of rendering you happy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Ah</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>While we love, while we are
true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
peace</span>
