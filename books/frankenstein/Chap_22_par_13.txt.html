<span class = 'sc08'>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
to travel on</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>For my own part I was not sorry</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I had now neglected my
promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s
disappointment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
on my relatives</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I waited
for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
read and ascertain my fate</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Sometimes I thought that the fiend
followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
his destroyer</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
consciousness of which haunted me</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>I was guiltless, but I had indeed
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime</span>
