<span class = 'sc03'>“They were not entirely happy</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The young man and his companion often
went apart and appeared to weep</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I saw no cause for their unhappiness,
but I was deeply affected by it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>If such lovely creatures were
miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
should be wretched</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They
possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day
looks of affection and kindness</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>What did their tears imply</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Did they
really express pain</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I was at first unable to solve these questions,
but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
were at first enigmatic</span>
