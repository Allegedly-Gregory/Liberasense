<span class = 'sc02'>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
voiceless grief of my Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This also was my doing</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>And my
father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
the work of my thrice-accursed hands</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
are not your last tears</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard</span>

Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments</span>
