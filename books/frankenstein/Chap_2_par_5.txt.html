<span class = 'sc05'>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
relations of things</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,

to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species</span>

of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us</span>

generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for

beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
ambition</span>
