<span class = 'sc02'>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
the fiend—“_I will be with you on your
wedding-night</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>On that night he
had determined to consummate his crimes by my death</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Well, be it so; a
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>If he
were vanquished, I should be a free man</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>What freedom</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Such as the
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless, and alone, but free</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Such would be my liberty except that in my
Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death</span>
