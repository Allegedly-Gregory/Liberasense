<span class = 'sc04'>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that I could taste joy</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>O blessed sleep</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Often, when most
miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Deprived of
this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>During the day I was
sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Often, when wearied by
a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
friends</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>What agonising fondness did I feel for them</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>How did I cling to
their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
persuade myself that they still lived</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>At such moments vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
ardent desire of my soul</span>
