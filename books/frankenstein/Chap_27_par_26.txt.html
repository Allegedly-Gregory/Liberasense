<span class = 'sc05'>Oh</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>If I do,
swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
and satisfy my vengeance in his death</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And do I dare to ask of you to
undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
No; I am not so selfish</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He is eloquent
and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
trust him not</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and fiend-like malice</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Hear him not; call on the names of William,
Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
thrust your sword into his heart</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I will hover near and direct the
steel aright</span>
