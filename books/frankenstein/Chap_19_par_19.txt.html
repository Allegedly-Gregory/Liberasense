<span class = 'sc07'>â€œI continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
of a cypress</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She continued her course along the precipitous sides
of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
rapid stream</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She
was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>On
seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I followed speedily, I
hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I sank to the ground, and my
injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood</span>
