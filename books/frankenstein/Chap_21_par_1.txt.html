Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I found that I could not
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
fatherâ€™s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>My
father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>At these moments I took
refuge in the most perfect solitude</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I passed whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves, silent and listless</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
and a more cheerful heart</span>
