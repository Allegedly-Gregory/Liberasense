<span class = 'sc07'>The appearance of Justine was calm</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Yet she appeared confident in
innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>She
was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When she entered the
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
her utter guiltlessness</span>
