<span class = 'sc05'>What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Sometimes, indeed, he
left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
me and instigated my fury</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“My reign is not yet

inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Follow me; I
seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
cold and frost, to which I am impassive</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>You will find near this place, if
you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Come on, my
enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
hours must you endure until that period shall arrive</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
