<span class = 'sc08'>“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>If you
feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
marriage</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>You
are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
plans of honour and utility that you may have formed</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Do not suppose,
however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
your part would cause me any serious uneasiness</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Interpret my words
with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
sincerity</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
