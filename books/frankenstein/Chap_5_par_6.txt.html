<span class = 'sc08'>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
subject</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
to your destruction and infallible misery</span>

precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
will allow</span>
