<span class = 'sc02'>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>It
advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once
with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a blasted stump</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>When we visited it the next morning, we found
the tree shattered in a singular manner</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It was not splintered by the
shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I never beheld
anything so utterly destroyed</span>
