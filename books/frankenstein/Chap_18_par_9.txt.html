<span class = 'sc05'>“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity</span>

and friendship</span>

to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate</span>

postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail</span>

day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have added to my sagacity</span>
