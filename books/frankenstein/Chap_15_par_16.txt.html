<span class = 'sc05'>â€œMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>During the morning I
attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
observing my friends</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When they had retired to rest, if there was any
moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
my own food and fuel for the cottage</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>When I returned, as often as it
was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those
offices that I had seen done by Felix</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I afterwards found that these
labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification
of these terms</span>
