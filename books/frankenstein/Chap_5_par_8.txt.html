<span class = 'sc08'>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Life and death
appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A new species would bless
me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
owe their being to me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>No father could claim the gratitude of his
child so completely as I should deserve theirs</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Pursuing these
reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption</span>
