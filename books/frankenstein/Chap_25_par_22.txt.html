<span class = 'sc08'>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I read and reread her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Yet I would die to make
her happy</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>My
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He had vowed
_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
after the enunciation of his threats</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I resolved, therefore, that if my
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life
should not retard it a single hour</span>
