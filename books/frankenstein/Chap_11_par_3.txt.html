<span class = 'sc05'>The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Several strange facts combined
against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
of her innocence as I had</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>She had been out the whole of the night on
which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
murdered child had been afterwards found</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The woman asked her what she
did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>She returned to the house about eight
oâ€™clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anything had been heard concerning him</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>When shown the body, she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court</span>
