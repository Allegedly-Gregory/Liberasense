<span class = 'sc05'>â€œLast Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in Plainpalais</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We accordingly rested on a seat until
they should return</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return</span>
