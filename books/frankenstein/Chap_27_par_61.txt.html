<span class = 'sc03'>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I sat
by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
said, â€œAlas</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Think
not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>During these last days I
have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-being</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
that</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first creature</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
know where this thirst for vengeance may end</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Miserable himself that he may
render no other wretched, he ought to die</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The task of his destruction was
mine, but I have failed</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I
asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,
when I am only induced by reason and virtue</span>
