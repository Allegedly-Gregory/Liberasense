<span class = 'sc08'>They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready
a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one
that had a good thing, according to my notion</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then the Reverend Hobson
opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only
one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right
along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you
couldn't hear yourself think</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It was right down awkward, and nobody
didn't seem to know what to do</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But pretty soon they see that
long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
“Don't you worry--just depend on me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  Then he stooped down and begun
to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's
heads</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and
more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two
sides of the room, he disappears down cellar</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Then in about two seconds
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his
mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,
over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He
had a rat_</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to
his place</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
because naturally they wanted to know</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> A little thing like that don't
cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be
looked up to and liked</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> There warn't no more popular man in town than
what that undertaker was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
