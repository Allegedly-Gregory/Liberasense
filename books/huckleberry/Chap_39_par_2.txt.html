<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc07'>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's
nest, but we didn't</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The family was at home</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We didn't give it right
up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd
tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
again, but couldn't set down convenient</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And so we went for the snakes,
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in
a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and
a rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>--oh, no, I reckon not</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't
half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But it didn't
matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So
we judged we could get some of them again</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No, there warn't no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> You'd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most
of the time where you didn't want them</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Well, they was handsome and
striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never
made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what
they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and
every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference
what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
never see such a woman</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And you could hear her whoop to Jericho</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> You
couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She disturbed the old
man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes
created</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't
near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
right out of her stockings</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was very curious</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But Tom said all
women was just so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He said they was made that way for some reason or
other</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
