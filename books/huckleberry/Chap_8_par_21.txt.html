<p class='sc04'>
<span class = 'sc04'>So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The moon was
shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
asleep</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> A
little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying
the night was about done</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge
of the woods</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the
leaves</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket
the river</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
and knowed the day was coming</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> So I took my gun and slipped off towards
where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two
to listen</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the
place</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away
through the trees</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I went for it, cautious and slow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> By and by I was
close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It
most give me the fan-tods</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He had a blanket around his head, and his
head was nearly in the fire</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I set there behind a clump of bushes, in
about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was getting
gray daylight now</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I bet I was glad to see
him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I says:</span>
