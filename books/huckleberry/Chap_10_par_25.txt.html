<span class = 'sc03'>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>By
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
towards Geneva</span>
