<span class = 'sc05'>I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I took one slow step at
a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart</span>

 The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting</span>

little and a little more till somebody said, “There, that's enough--put
your head in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” I done it, but I judged they would take it off</span>
