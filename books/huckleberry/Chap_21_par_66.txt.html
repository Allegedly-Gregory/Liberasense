<span class = 'sc05'>Then he turns and goes in</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
stirred, and there warn't no more laughing</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Boggs rode off
blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping
it up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen
minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But it didn't
do no good</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
the street again, with his gray hair a-flying</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Everybody that could get
a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street
he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> By and by
somebody says:</span>
