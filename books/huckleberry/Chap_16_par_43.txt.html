<span class = 'sc03'>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me
to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get _started_ right when
he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing
to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then I
thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right
and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No, says
I, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Well, then, says
I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do
right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
 I was stuck</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I couldn't answer that</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> So I reckoned I wouldn't bother
no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
the time</span>
