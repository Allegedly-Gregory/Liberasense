<span class = 'sc06'>When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his
black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last
touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,
and making no more sound than a cat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He never spoke; he moved people
around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done
it with nods, and signs with his hands</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then he took his place over
against the wall</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever
see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham</span>
