<span class = 'sc05'>A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off
of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> And afterwards we would watch
the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by
lazy off to sleep</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was
a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be
nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Next
you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the
axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go
up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the
_k'chunk_</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--it had took all that time to come over the water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So we
would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Once
there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> A scow or a
raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made
you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air</span>

 Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:</span>
