<span class = 'sc04'>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I never see a family in such a sweat</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> They couldn't a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> If
a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” if anything fell,
she jumped and said “ouch</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>” if you happened to touch her, when she
warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be
satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and
before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it
again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> So the
thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work
more satisfactory</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He said it showed it was done right</span>
