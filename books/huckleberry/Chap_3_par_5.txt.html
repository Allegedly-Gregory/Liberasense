<span class = 'sc06'> I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He said there was
loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
and elephants and things</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I said, why couldn't we see them, then</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He
said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
would know without asking</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He said it was all done by enchantment</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He
said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
magicians</span>
