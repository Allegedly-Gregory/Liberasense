<span class = 'sc04'>I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I took all the coffee and
sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the
bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I took fish-lines and
matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I cleaned
out the place</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out
at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I fetched
out the gun, and now I was done</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
