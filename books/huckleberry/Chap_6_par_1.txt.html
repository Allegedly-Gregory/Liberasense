WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I didn't want to go to school much
before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> That law trial was a
slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;
so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Every time he got money he
got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
every time he raised Cain he got jailed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He was just suited--this kind
of thing was right in his line</span>
