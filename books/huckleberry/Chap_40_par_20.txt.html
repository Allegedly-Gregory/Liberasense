My, but there was a crowd there</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
had a gun</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down</span>

They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;
but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,
and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
seats, and fumbling with their buttons</span>

didn't take my hat off, all the same</span>
