<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc05'>All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else _but_
mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The hogs loafed and
grunted around everywheres</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs
come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,
where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her
eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as
happy as if she was on salary</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer
sing out, “Hi</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> _so_ boy</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>sick him, Tige</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>” and away the sow would go,
squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and
three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the
loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun
and look grateful for the noise</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Then they'd settle back again till
there was a dog fight</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> There couldn't anything wake them up all over,
and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be
putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a
tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death</span>
