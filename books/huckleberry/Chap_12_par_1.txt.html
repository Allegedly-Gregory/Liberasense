IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at
last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> If a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to
put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We
was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> It warn't
good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft</span>
