<span class = 'sc07'>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was a
monotonous yet ever-changing scene</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I thought of Switzerland; it was
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Its hills
are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
plains</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean</span>
