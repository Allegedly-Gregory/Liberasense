<span class = 'sc04'>
 The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he
had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
of me and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>and I lit
out</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It didn't seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn't do nothing,
and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> So I never stopped
running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was
awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't</span>
