<p class='sc07'>
<span class = 'sc03'>I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't
know</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town
go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
ever</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees--something was a stirring</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I set still and listened</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Directly I
could just barely hear a “me-yow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>me-yow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” down there</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> That was good</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 Says I, “me-yow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>me-yow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” as soft as I could, and then I put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then I slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
