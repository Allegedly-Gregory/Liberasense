<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc06'>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone
nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> It warn't quite midnight yet,
so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We smouched the
grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
job</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling
over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Tom said she was
going to get one of us, sure, before we got through</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We got her half
way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> We
see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>So he raised up his
bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round
his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim
and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
Tom superintended</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He could out-superintend any boy I ever see</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He
knowed how to do everything</span>
