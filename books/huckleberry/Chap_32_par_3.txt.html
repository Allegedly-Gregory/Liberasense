<span class = 'sc05'>I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and
started for the kitchen</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Â When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum
of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;
and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the
lonesomest sound in the whole world</span>
