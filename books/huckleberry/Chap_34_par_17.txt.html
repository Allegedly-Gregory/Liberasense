Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
island</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
Jim used to do before</span>
