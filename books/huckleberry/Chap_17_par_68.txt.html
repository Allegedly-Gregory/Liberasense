<span class = 'sc07'>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> She didn't ever have to
stop to think</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one, and go ahead</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She warn't particular; she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on
hand with her “tribute” before he was cold</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She called them tributes</span>

The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was
Whistler</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,
but she kinder pined away and did not live long</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Poor thing, many's the
time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and I had soured on her a little</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I liked all that
family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between
us</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some
about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> They kept Emmeline's
room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she
liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
mostly</span>
