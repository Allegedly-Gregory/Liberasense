<span class = 'sc05'>Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But I said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I
warn't in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I didn't want him to try</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I said Jim
might wake up and come</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
something on him</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
so still and lonesome</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
