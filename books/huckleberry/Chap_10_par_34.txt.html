<p class='sc03'>
<span class = 'sc05'>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The gates were
open, and I hastened to my father’s house</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>My first thought was to
discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
made</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A
being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I
remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
as to persuade my relatives to commence it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And then of what use would
be pursuit</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of Mont Salêve</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>These reflections determined me, and
I resolved to remain silent</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
