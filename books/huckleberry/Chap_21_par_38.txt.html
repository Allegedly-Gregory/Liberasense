<span class = 'sc06'>The stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The houses had little
gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up
boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
tin-ware</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
didn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Some of the fences
had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
Clumbus's time, like enough</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was generly hogs in the garden, and
people driving them out</span>
