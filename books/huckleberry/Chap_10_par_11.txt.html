<span class = 'sc03'>Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Jim liked that notion; but he said I
must go in the dark and look sharp</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then he studied it over and said,
couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 That was a good notion, too</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So we shortened up one of the calico
gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim said
nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I practiced around
all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty
well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said
I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I took
notice, and done better</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
