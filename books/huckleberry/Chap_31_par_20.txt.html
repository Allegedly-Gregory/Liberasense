<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc05'>It made me shiver</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So
I kneeled down</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But the words wouldn't come</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why wouldn't they</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> It
warn't no use to try and hide it from Him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Nor from _me_, neither</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I
knowed very well why they wouldn't come</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> It was because my heart warn't
right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing
double</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
holding on to the biggest one of all</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I was trying to make my mouth
_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write
to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> You can't pray a lie--I found
that out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
