the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when
it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  Jim
couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>“And besides,” I says,
“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom</span>

 Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Steamboat

care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it</span>

 Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Not for pie, he
wouldn't</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd
land on that wreck if it was his last act</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And wouldn't he throw style
into it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, you'd think it
was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I wish Tom Sawyer
_was_ here</span>
