<span class = 'sc08'>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I hadn't
seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
town</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> There was a big fireplace that
was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
same as they do in town</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
up a saw-log</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with
a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and
a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
pendulum swinging behind it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;
and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her
up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
and fifty before she got tuckered out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They wouldn't took any money for
her</span>
