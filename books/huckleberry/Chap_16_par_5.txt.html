<span class = 'sc05'>But it warn't</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
down again, and went to watching, same as before</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Well, I can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
who was to blame for it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, _me_</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I couldn't get that out of my
conscience, no how nor no way</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It got to troubling me so I couldn't
rest; I couldn't stay still in one place</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It hadn't ever come home to
me before, what this thing was that I was doing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But now it did; and it
stayed with me, and scorched me more and more</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I tried to make out to
myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his
rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every
time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
paddled ashore and told somebody</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  That was so--I couldn't get around
that noway</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That was where it pinched</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Conscience says to me, “What
had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
right under your eyes and never say one single word</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> What did that poor
old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Why, she tried to
learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
be good to you every way she knowed how</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> _That's_ what she done</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
