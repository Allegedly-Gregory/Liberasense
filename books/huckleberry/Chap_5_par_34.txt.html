<span class = 'sc03'>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The
judge's wife she kissed it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then the old man he signed a pledge--made
his mark</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
like that</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it</span>
