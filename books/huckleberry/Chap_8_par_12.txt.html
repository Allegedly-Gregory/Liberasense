<span class = 'sc05'>And so for three days and nights</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No difference--just the same thing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I was
boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know
all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I found plenty
strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They
would all come handy by and by, I judged</span>
