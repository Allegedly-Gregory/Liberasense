<span class = 'sc05'>“Stand away</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and
I judged I was gone</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd
a got the corpse they was after</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to
goodness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I could hear the booming now and then, further and
further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 The island was three mile long</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I judged they had got to the foot, and
was giving it up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But they didn't yet a while</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They turned around
the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,
under steam, and booming once in a while as they went</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I crossed over
to that side and watched them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When they got abreast the head of the
island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
went home to the town</span>
