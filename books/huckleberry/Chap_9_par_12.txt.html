<span class = 'sc05'>Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She was
a two-story, and tilted over considerable</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We paddled out and got
aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But it was too dark to see yet,
so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight</span>
