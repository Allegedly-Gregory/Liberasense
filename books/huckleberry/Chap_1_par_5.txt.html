<span class = 'sc07'>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But she
wouldn't</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must
try to not do it any more</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That is just the way with some people</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They
get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Here she was
a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,
being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And she took snuff, too; of course that
was all right, because she done it herself</span>
