<span class = 'sc05'>I didn't look at him at all</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was heaps of old
greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal</span>

 There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,
too</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was a
boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> And there
was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
baby to suck</span>

<span class = 'sc03'> There was
a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke</span>

stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account</span>
