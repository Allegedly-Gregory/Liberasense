disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
your success</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
neglected the other branches of science</span>

<span class = 'sc08'>If your
wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
philosophy, including mathematics</span>
