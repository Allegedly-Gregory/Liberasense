<span class = 'sc03'>But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around
front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do
something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never
do nothing to grieve her any more</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Â And the third time I waked up at
dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,
and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep</span>
