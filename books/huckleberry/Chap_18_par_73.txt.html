<span class = 'sc05'>The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He didn't know what
to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He was awful
surprised</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the
men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
other--wouldn't be gone long</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I wished I was out of that tree, but I
dasn't come down</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and
his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this
day yet</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
or three of the enemy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
ambush</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their
relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I asked him what
was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He said they'd got across
the river and was safe</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take
on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I
hain't ever heard anything like it</span>
