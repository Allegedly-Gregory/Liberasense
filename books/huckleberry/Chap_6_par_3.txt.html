<span class = 'sc04'>He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off</span>

We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
key under his head nights</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Every little
while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
drunk and had a good time, and licked me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The widow she found out where
I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was
used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part</span>
