<span class = 'sc04'>“Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> You _can_ get up the
infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, hain't you ever read
any books at all</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,
nor Henri IV</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>, nor none of them heroes</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> No; the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just
so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see
no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip
off your chain, and there you are</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Nothing to do but hitch your
rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and
there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and
fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
Navarre, or wherever it is</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It's gaudy, Huck</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I wish there was a moat
to this cabin</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
