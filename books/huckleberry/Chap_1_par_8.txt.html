<span class = 'sc03'>Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then I set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I felt
so lonesome I most wished I was dead</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> The stars were shining, and the
leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying
to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so
it made the cold shivers run over me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Then away out in the woods I heard
that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about
something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so
can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night
grieving</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
was all shriveled up</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was
an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
and most shook the clothes off of me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But
I hadn't no confidence</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that
you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever
heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed
a spider</span>
