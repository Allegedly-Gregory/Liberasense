<span class = 'sc08'>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
Sally was gone to get a nap</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
would wash</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I set down and
laid for him to wake</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
in, and there I was, up a stump again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She motioned me to be still, and
set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping
like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind</span>
