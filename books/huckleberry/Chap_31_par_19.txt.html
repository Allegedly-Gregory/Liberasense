<span class = 'sc08'>Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to
be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a
slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to
tell Miss Watson where he was</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> But I soon give up that notion for two
things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and
disgraced</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And then think of _me_</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It would get all around that Huck
Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see
anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots
for shame</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
then he don't want to take no consequences of it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Thinks as long as he
can hide it, it ain't no disgrace</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That was my fix exactly</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The more I
studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the
more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>And at last, when
it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was
showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going
to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,
I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Well, I tried the best I
could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me
kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and
if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as
I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
