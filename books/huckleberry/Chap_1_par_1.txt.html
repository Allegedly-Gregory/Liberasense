YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That book was made
by Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> There was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That is nothing</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she
is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before</span>
