<span class = 'sc05'>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by, and then dived in under the tent</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I had my twenty-dollar gold
piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
home and amongst strangers that way</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> You can't be too careful</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I ain't
opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but
there ain't no use in _wasting_ it on them</span>
