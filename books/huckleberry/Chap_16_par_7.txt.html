<span class = 'sc05'>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Â He was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to
where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the
two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an
Ab'litionist to go and steal them</span>
