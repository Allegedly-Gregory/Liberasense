<span class = 'sc07'>Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
that kind</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you
was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't
anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned
it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So we talked it over all
one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
or what</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and
concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> We warn't feeling just
right before that, but it was all comfortable now</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I was glad the way
it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons
wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet</span>
