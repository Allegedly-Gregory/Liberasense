<span class = 'sc05'>It did come, too</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was a Tuesday that we had that talk</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge, and got out of tobacco</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went to the cavern to get some, and
found a rattlesnake in there</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I killed him, and curled him up on the
foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun
when Jim found him there</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
the snake's mate was there, and bit him</span>
