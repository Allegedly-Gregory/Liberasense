<span class = 'sc05'>The fifth night below St</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
and high, rocky bluffs on both sides</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,
looky yonder</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 We was drifting straight down for her</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The lightning showed her very
distinct</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
when the flashes come</span>
