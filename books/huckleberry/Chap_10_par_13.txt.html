<p class='sc06'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
tied up and started along the bank</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was a light burning in a
little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
who had took up quarters there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I slipped up and peeped in at the
window</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
a candle that was on a pine table</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I didn't know her face; she was a
stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had
come; people might know my voice and find me out</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But if this woman had
been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to
know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I
was a girl</span>
