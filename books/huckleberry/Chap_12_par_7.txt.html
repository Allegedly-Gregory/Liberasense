<span class = 'sc05'>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The
fifth night we passed St</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
In St</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two o'clock that still night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There warn't a sound
there; everybody was asleep</span>
