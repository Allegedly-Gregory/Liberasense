<span class = 'sc03'> The average man don't like trouble and
danger</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>_You_ don't like trouble and danger</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But if only _half_ a
man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>lynch him</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>you're
afraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what you
are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that
half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
things you're going to do</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's
what an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in
them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their
officers</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_
pitifulness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and
go home and crawl in a hole</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> If any real lynching's going to be done it
will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll
bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Now _leave_--and take your
half-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
it when he says this</span>
