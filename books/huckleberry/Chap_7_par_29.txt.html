<span class = 'sc05'>I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> A
monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
with a lantern in the middle of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I watched it come creeping down,
and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern
oars, there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>heave her head to stabboard</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  I heard that just as plain
as if the man was by my side</span>
