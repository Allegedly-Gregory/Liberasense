<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc04'>I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the
thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the
money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then the king
'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody
another chance to smouch it from him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Of course I _wanted_ to slide
down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Every minute it was
getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin
to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my
hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I don't wish to be
mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself</span>
