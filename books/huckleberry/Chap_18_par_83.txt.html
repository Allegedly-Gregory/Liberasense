<span class = 'sc03'>I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
the middle of the Mississippi</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
judged that we was free and safe once more</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I hadn't had a bite to eat
since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so good
when it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We said there warn't no home like a
raft, after all</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
raft don't</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft</span>
