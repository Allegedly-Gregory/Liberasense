<span class = 'sc05'>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> The men
was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run
away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
whole family scared most to death for days and nights</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> But the others
said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and
his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> So that cooled
them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very
ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their
satisfaction out of him</span>
