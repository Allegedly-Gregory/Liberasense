<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc07'>Everyone loved Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
pride and my delight</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>On the evening previous to her being brought to
my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my
Victor—tomorrow he shall have it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  And when, on the morrow, she
presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>All praises bestowed on
her I received as made to a possession of my own</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We called each other
familiarly by the name of cousin</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>No word, no expression could body
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than
sister, since till death she was to be mine only</span>
