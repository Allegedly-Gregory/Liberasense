<span class = 'sc04'>And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Jim and me got uneasy</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We didn't like the look of it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> We judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We turned it
over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
business, or something</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>So then we was pretty scared, and made up an
agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such
actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Well, early one morning we
hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>(“House to
rob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it
you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
raft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”) And he said if he
warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
we was to come along</span>
