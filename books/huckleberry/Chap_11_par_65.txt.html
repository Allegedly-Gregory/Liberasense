<span class = 'sc07'>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
jumped in, and was off in a hurry</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went up-stream far enough to
make the head of the island, and then started across</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I took off the
sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> When I was about the
middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> When I struck the
head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot</span>
