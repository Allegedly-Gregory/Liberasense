<span class = 'sc05'>Jim was laid up for four days and nights</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then the swelling was all
gone and he was around again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> And he said
that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't
got to the end of it yet</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
in his hand</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've
always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Old Hank
Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
they say, but I didn't see it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Pap told me</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But anyway it all come of
looking at the moon that way, like a fool</span>
