<span class = 'sc07'>If thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
that which I feel</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them for ever</span>
