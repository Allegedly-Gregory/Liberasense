<p class='sc02'>
<span class = 'sc05'>My heart jumped up amongst my lungs</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I never waited for to look
further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
fast as ever I could</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
nothing else</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
and so on, and so on</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my
breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too</span>
