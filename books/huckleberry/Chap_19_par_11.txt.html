<span class = 'sc05'>One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and
a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He had
an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags</span>
