<span class = 'sc05'>The duke said what he was after was a printing-office</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We found it;
a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> It was a dirty,
littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So me and the king lit out for
the camp-meeting</span>
