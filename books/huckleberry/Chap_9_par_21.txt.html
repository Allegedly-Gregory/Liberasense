<span class = 'sc07'>And so, take it all around, we made a good haul</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
ways off</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most
a half a mile doing it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I crept up the dead water under the bank, and
hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We got home all safe</span>
