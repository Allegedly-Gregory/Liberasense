<p class='sc03'>
<span class = 'sc06'>I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> When
I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I set up and looked
around, a little scared</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then I remembered</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The river looked miles and
miles across</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
