<span class = 'sc05'>“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says
to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went
a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> A man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch
a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,
and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
him</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We never got him till dark; then we
fetched him over, and I started down for the raft</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> When I got there and
see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to
leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in
the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property
no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and
cried</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I slept in the woods all night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But what _did_ become of the
raft, then</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--and Jim--poor Jim</span>
