<span class = 'sc07'>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good
place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They
laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened
another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt
first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He made about a
dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his
breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that
he laid still; he was dead</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Then they pulled his daughter away from
him, screaming and crying, and took her off</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> She was about sixteen, and
very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared</span>
