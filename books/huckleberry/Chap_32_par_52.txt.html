<span class = 'sc08'>Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then I says to myself, s'pose
Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And s'pose he steps in here any
minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
quiet</span>
