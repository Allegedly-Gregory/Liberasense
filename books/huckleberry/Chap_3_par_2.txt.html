<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why can't the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Why can't Miss Watson fat up</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I went and told the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
it was “spiritual gifts</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>”  This was too many for me, but she told me
what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for
other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
myself</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>This was including Miss Watson, as I took it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I went out in the
woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no
advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned
I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
and knock it all down again</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I judged I could see that there was two
Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help
for him any more</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was
a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery</span>
