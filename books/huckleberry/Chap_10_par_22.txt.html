<span class = 'sc08'>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“Poor William</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>” said he,
“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Who that had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>How
much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Poor little
fellow</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
he is at rest</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He can no longer
be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
survivors</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
