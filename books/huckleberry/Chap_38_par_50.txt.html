<span class = 'sc04'> All animals like music--in a

<span class = 'sc07'> Specially, painful music; and you can't get no
other kind out of a jews-harp</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> It always interests them; they come out

<span class = 'sc08'> Yes, you're all right; you're fixed

<span class = 'sc08'> You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,
and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link
is Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything
else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats,
and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,
and come</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good
time</span>
