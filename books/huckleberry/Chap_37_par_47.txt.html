<span class = 'sc03'>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> We
fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we
couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But of course
we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
in the pie</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
with</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We let on it took nine months to make it</span>
