<span class = 'sc05'>I remained motionless</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The thunder ceased; but the rain still
continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
was this his first crime</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I had turned loose into the world a
depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
murdered my brother</span>
