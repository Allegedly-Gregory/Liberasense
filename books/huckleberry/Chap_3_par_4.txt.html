<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc03'>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> All
the boys did</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but
only just pretended</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”
 and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the
cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
and marked</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But I couldn't see no profit in it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> One time Tom sent a
boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he
had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter”
 mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called
it, and kill the lot and scoop the things</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He said we must slick up
our swords and guns, and get ready</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He never could go after even a
turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more
than what they was before</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd
of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,
so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But there warn't
no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
at that</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got
a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut</span>
