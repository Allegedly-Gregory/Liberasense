<span class = 'sc05'>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But we
didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
more</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
meanest thing to fog</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> You can't tell the shape of the river, and you
can't see no distance</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It got to be very late and still, and then along
comes a steamboat up the river</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We lit the lantern, and judged she
would see it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they
go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river</span>
