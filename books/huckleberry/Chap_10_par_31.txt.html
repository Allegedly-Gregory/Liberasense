<span class = 'sc08'>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
a hasty step</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>this is thy
funeral, this thy dirge</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” As I said these words, I perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A flash of lightning
illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
dæmon, to whom I had given life</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What did he there</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Could he be (I
shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>No sooner did that
idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The figure
passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Nothing in human shape could
have destroyed the fair child</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>_He_ was the murderer</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I could not
doubt it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
fact</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
south</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He soon reached the summit, and disappeared</span>
