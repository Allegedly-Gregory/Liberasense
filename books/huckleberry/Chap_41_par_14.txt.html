<span class = 'sc06'>I struck an idea pretty soon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
spos'n it takes him three or four days</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> What are we going to do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--lay
around there till he lets the cat out of the bag</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No, sir; I know what
_I'll_ do</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to
go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie
him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done
with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him
get ashore</span>
