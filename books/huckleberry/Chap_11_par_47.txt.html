<span class = 'sc08'>So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't
go back on her promise</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Then I told her my father and mother was dead,
and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it
no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and
I had been three nights coming the thirty miles</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I traveled nights,
and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I said I believed my
uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck
out for this town of Goshen</span>
