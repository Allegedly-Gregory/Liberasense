<span class = 'sc05'>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim told
me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the
body and roast a piece of it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
his wrist, too</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He said that that would help</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Then I slid out quiet
and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going
to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it</span>
