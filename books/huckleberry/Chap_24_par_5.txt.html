<span class = 'sc03'>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe
the news might a worked along down by this time</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> They couldn't hit no
project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up
something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence
to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n
on, and he told me to put mine on</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I done it, of course</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The king's
duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I never
knowed how clothes could change a body before</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, before, he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off
his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,
and maybe was old Leviticus himself</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
got my paddle ready</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
of hours, taking on freight</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Says the king:</span>
