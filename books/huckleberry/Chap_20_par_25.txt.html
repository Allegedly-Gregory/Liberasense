<span class = 'sc05'>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The king allowed he would go,
too, and see if he couldn't strike something</span>
