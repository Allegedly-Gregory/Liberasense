<span class = 'sc05'>The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He lined
out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The people woke up
more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some
begun to groan, and some begun to shout</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then the preacher begun to
preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front
of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his
words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
that, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Look upon
it and live</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  And people would shout out, “Glory</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--A-a-_men_</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>”  And so
he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:</span>
