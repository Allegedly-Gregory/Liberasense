<span class = 'sc06'> Well, I reckon you'd _think_
so if you'd a been in this house for a while back</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, they've stole
everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,
mind you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They stole that shirt right off o' the line</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>and as for that
sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how
many times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and
candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand
things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and
Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was
a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight
nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they
slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_
but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that
nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs
right on their very heels at that very time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I tell you, it just bangs
anything I ever _heard_ of</span>

been no smarter</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_
know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got
on the _track_ of 'm once</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> You explain _that_ to me if you can</span>
