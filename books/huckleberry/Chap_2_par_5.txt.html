<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc05'>So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> My nose begun to itch</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It itched till the tears come into
my eyes</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But I dasn't scratch</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then it begun to itch on the inside</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Next I got to itching underneath</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I didn't know how I was going to set
still</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
it seemed a sight longer than that</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I was itching in eleven different
places now</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,
but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Just then Jim begun
to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon
comfortable again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
