as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> So I was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I needn't tell what it was here,

<span class = 'sc06'> I knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And that is what he done</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
