<span class = 'sc03'>When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand
in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around</span>

got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
