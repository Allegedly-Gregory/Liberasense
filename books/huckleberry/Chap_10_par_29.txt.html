<span class = 'sc05'>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The sky
was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot
where my poor William had been murdered</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>As I could not pass through the
town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont
Blanc in the most beautiful figures</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The storm appeared to approach
rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
progress</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased</span>
