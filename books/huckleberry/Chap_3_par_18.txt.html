<span class = 'sc05'>I closed not my eyes that night</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My internal being was in a state of
insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
had no power to produce it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,
sleep came</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
natural talent</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>On the same day I paid M</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Waldman a visit</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>His
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
given to his fellow professor</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He heard with attention the little
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Krempe had
exhibited</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledge</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>”  I
listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
labours</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
procure</span>
