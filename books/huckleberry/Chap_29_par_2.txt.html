<span class = 'sc02'>“This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and
answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his
arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the
night by a mistake</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his
brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to
amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We are
who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can
prove it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel
and wait</span>
