<span class = 'sc05'>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding, besides some tow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I toted up a load, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I thought it all
over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
take to the woods when I run away</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I guessed I wouldn't stay in one
place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldn't ever find me any more</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old
man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded</span>
