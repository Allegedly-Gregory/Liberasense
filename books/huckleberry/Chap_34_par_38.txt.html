<span class = 'sc02'>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
all tied up in little bunches with thread</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That was to keep witches

making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so

about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do</span>
