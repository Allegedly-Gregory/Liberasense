<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc05'>So Tom was stumped</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
have to worry along the best he could with an onion</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He promised
he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's
coffee-pot, in the morning</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Jim said he would “jis' 's soon have
tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the
work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,
and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to
be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all
patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was
just about wasted on him</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't
behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed</span>
