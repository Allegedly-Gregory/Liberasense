<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc04'>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
hot</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We
talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but
about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit
up, how was we going to know we was passing a town</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim said if the two
big rivers joined together there, that would show</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But I said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
same old river again</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>That disturbed Jim--and me too</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So the question
was, what to do</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
Cairo</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited</span>
