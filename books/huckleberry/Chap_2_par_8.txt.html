<span class = 'sc06'>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
awful still and grand</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and
Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard</span>

 So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,
to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore</span>
