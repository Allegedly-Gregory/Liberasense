them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He has done generous by
these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left
fatherless and motherless</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done _more_ generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'
his dear William and me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Now, _wouldn't_ he</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Ther' ain't no question

<span class = 'sc08'> Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be
that 'd stand in his way at sech a time</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And what kind o' uncles would
it be that 'd rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved

the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then the king says,
“I knowed it; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels
about it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it
_all_</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful</span>
