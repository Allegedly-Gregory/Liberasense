<span class = 'sc06'>Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then I
took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't
drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Now I thought of something else</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I went and got the bag
of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the
place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then
I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There
was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I dropped
pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by
accident</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it
wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
