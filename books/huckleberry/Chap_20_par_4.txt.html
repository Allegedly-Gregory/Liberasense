<span class = 'sc03'>“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Pa, he 'lowed
he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little
one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Pa was
pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> That warn't
enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
years old, so they never come up no more</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Well, for the next day or
two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was
a runaway nigger</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't
bother us</span>
