<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc05'>We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his
horse easy and looking like a soldier</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He had his gun across his
pommel</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I had seen him before</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was young Harney Shepherdson</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I
heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his
head</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
hid</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But we didn't wait</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We started through the woods on a run</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> The
woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,
and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away
the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> We never
stopped running till we got home</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> The old gentleman's eyes blazed a
minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed
down, and he says, kind of gentle:</span>
