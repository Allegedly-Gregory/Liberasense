<span class = 'sc07'>The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped
around and lit into _me_ again</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He give me down the banks for not
coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting
that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> And then
waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not
laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be
blamed if he'd ever do it again</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> So they went off a-jawing; and I felt
dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't
