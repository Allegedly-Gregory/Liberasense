<p class='sc02'>
<span class = 'sc05'>So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> When
I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I says to myself,
shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> No--that
won't do</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would
make it warm for me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> No--I
dasn't do it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the
money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> If she was to
fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,
I judge</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No; there ain't no good way but one</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I got to steal that
money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion
that I done it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going
to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're
worth, so I'll find a chance time enough</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I'll steal it and hide it; and
by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell
Mary Jane where it's hid</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But I better hive it tonight if I can,
because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he
might scare them out of here yet</span>
