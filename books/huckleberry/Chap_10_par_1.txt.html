AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He said it would fetch bad
luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man
that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one
that was planted and comfortable</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> That sounded pretty reasonable, so
I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and
wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for</span>
