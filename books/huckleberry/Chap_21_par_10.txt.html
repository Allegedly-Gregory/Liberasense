every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would

he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was beautiful

he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,
all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before</span>
