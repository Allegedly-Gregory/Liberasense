<span class = 'sc08'>I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> And
then something struck me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
and done it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that
thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the
parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for
only just the right kind</span>
