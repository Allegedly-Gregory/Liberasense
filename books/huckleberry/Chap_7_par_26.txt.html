<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc07'> I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
away into the sky; not a cloud in it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The sky looks ever so deep when
you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 And how far a body can hear on the water such nights</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I heard people
talking at the ferry landing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I heard what they said, too--every word
of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
nights now</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he
reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
let him alone</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his
old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't
nothing to some things he had said in his time</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I heard one man say it
was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than
about a week longer</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> After that the talk got further and further away,
and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,
and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off</span>
