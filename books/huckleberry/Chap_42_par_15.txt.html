<span class = 'sc08'>“Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't
a bad nigger</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut
the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for
me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let
me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill
me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do
anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and
the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says
he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Of course I
judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>and there I had
to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It
was a fix, I tell you</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,
because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet
never a skiff come close enough for me to hail</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> So there I had to stick
plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked
main hard lately</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I
had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he
would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about
dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck
would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped
on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was
about, and we never had no trouble</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>And the boy being in a kind of a
flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
row nor said a word from the start</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen;
that's what I think about him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
