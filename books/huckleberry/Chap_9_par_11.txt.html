<span class = 'sc05'>One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and
the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor</span>

could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;
we didn't show ourselves in daylight</span>
