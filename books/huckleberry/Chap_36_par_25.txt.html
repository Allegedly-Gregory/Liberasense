<span class = 'sc08'>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Tom was in high
spirits</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to
get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the
more he got used to it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He said that in that way it could be strung out
to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And he
said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it</span>
