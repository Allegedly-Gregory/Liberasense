<span class = 'sc07'>I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up
at that place and didn't quite touch ground</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> If you stood four or five
foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice
it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely
anybody would go fooling around there</span>
