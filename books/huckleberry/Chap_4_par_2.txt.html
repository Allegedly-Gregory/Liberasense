<span class = 'sc03'>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
day done me good and cheered me up</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> So the longer I went to school the
easier it got to be</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways,
too, and they warn't so raspy on me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Living in a house and sleeping in
a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I
used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
rest to me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
new ones, too, a little bit</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>The widow said I was coming along slow but
sure, and doing very satisfactory</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She said she warn't ashamed of me</span>
