<span class = 'sc05'>“Your head's level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where I was</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
I'd better do if they did catch me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But the king he got the bag before
I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned
I was around</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw
tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two
amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only
makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about
twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now</span>
