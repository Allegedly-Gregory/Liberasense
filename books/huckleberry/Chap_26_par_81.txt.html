<span class = 'sc05'>So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Upstairs the hall was
dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with
my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let
anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to
his room and begun to paw around there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But I see I couldn't do nothing
without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I judged I'd
got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> About that time
I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I
reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched
the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and
snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still</span>
