<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc05'>But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand
it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I was all over welts</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He got to going away so much, too, and
locking me in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Once he locked me in and was gone three days</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> It was
dreadful lonesome</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever
going to get out any more</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I was scared</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I made up my mind I would fix
up some way to leave there</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I had tried to get out of that cabin many
a time, but I couldn't find no way</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There warn't a window to it big
enough for a dog to get through</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I couldn't get up the chimbly; it
was too narrow</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The door was thick, solid oak slabs</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Pap was pretty
careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
the time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
clapboards of the roof</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I greased it up and went to work</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was an
old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
putting the candle out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I got under the table and raised the blanket,
and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
to let me through</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I got rid of
the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
soon pap come in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
