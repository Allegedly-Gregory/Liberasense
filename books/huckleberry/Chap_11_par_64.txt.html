<span class = 'sc05'>“Well, try to remember it, George</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Don't forget and tell me it's
Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George
Elexander when I catch you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And don't go about women in that old
calico</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the
thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and
poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a
man always does t'other way</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> And when you throw at a rat or anything,
hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Throw
stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out
to one side, like a boy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them
together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Why, I
spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived
the other things just to make certain</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Now trot along to your uncle,
Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble
you send word to Mrs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can
to get you out of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Keep the river road all the way, and next time
you tramp take shoes and socks with you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The river road's a rocky one,
and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
