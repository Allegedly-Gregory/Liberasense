<span class = 'sc07'>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see
by the stars</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a
couple of sawlogs made fast together</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then I see another speck, and
chased that; then another, and this time I was right</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was the raft</span>
