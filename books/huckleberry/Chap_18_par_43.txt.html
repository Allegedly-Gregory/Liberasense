<span class = 'sc04'>Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So I give it a shake, and out drops a
little piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I couldn't make anything
out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> She
pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till
she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> She was
mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
made her powerful pretty</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper
warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
play now</span>
