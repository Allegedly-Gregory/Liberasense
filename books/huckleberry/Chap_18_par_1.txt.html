<span class = 'sc05'> Grangerford was a gentleman, you see</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He was a gentleman all
over; and so was his family</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He was well born, as the saying is, and
that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas
said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more
quality than a mudcat himself</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Col</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Grangerford was very tall and
very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
you, as you may say</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
straight and hung to his shoulders</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>His hands was long and thin, and
every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head
to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;
and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He
carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> There warn't no
frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He was
as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had
confidence</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,
and find out what the matter was afterwards</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He didn't ever have to
tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered
where he was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine
most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> When he turned
into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was
enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week</span>
