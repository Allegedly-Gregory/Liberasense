<span class = 'sc07'>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, then, the old thing
commenced again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
to time</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but
you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little
over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with
them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> In a
barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the
juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better</span>
