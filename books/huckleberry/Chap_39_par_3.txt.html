<span class = 'sc05'>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I didn't mind the lickings,
because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we
had to lay in another lot</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But we got them laid in, and all the other
things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd
all swarm out for music and go for him</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Jim didn't like the spiders,
and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it
mighty warm for him</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And he said that between the rats and the snakes
and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and
when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and
when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,
and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
him as he crossed over</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't
ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary</span>
