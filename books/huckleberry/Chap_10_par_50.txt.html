<span class = 'sc05'>We were soon joined by Elizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Time had altered her since I last
beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
She welcomed me with the greatest affection</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“Your arrival, my dear
cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor guiltless Justine</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>who is safe, if she
be convicted of crime</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
upon my own</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If she is condemned, I
never shall know joy more</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But she will not, I am sure she will not;
and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
William</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
