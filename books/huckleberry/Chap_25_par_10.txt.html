<span class = 'sc05'>Hobson and Dr</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other
world, and the preacher was pinting him right</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Lawyer Bell was away up
to Louisville on business</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> But the rest was on hand, and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just
kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst
he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo”
 all the time, like a baby that can't talk</span>
