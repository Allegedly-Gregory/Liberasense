<span class = 'sc04'>I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,
because they might see the smoke</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I set there and watched the
cannon-smoke and listened to the boom</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> The river was a mile wide there,
and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and
if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I
changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
have, and I warn't disappointed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> A big double loaf come along, and I
most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
further</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
shore--I knowed enough for that</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But by and by along comes another one,
and this time I won</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
of quicksilver, and set my teeth in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was “baker's bread”--what the
quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone</span>
