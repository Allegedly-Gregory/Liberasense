<span class = 'sc07'>It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We
seen a light now away down to the right, on shore</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I said I would
go for it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told
Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars
and shoved for the light</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> As I got down towards it three or four more
showed--up on a hillside</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was a village</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I closed in above the shore
light, and laid on my oars and floated</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> As I went by I see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I skimmed
around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between
his knees</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to
cry</span>
