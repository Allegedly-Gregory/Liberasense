<span class = 'sc05'>About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The
river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
rise</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then we had dinner</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
more stuff; but that warn't pap's style</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Nine logs was enough for one
time; he must shove right over to town and sell</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So he locked me in and
took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I judged he wouldn't come back that night</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I waited till I reckoned he
had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
log again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the
hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder</span>
