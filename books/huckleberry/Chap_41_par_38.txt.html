<span class = 'sc07'>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that
room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 So I done it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> And when
it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
told her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door was
locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try _that_
no more</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right
enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long
as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time
being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of
fretting over what was past and done</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> So then she kissed me, and patted
me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty
soon jumps up, and says:</span>
