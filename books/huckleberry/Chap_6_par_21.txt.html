<span class = 'sc04'>This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
several months</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>During all that time Henry was my only nurse</span>

afterwards learned that, knowing my fatherâ€™s advanced age and unfitness
for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
disorder</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
action that he could towards them</span>
