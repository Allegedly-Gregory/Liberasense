<span class = 'sc05'>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
continually beaten upon by the waves</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The soil was barren, scarcely
affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
gave tokens of their miserable fare</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
the mainland, which was about five miles distant</span>
