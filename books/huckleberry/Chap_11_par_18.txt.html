<span class = 'sc02'>“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> So there's a
reward out for him--three hundred dollars</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> And there's a reward out for
old Finn, too--two hundred dollars</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> You see, he come to town the
morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the
ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Before night they
wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Well, next day they
found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence
ten o'clock the night the murder was done</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> So then they put it on him,
you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,
and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the
nigger all over Illinois with</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The judge gave him some, and that evening
he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Well, he hain't
come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get
Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 People do say he warn't any too good to do it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Oh, he's sly, I reckon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> You can't prove
anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and
he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing</span>
