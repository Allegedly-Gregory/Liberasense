<span class = 'sc03'>“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My work
is nearly complete</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
but it requires my own</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
sacrifice</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
create such another as I have been</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I shall die</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I shall no longer feel the
agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
unquenched</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I shall no
longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Light,
feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
happiness</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Polluted by
crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
death</span>
