<span class = 'sc02'>To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of
so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come
to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the
innocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
There's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I
would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The
oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and the
quietus which his pangs might take</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In the dead waste and middle of the
night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But
that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of
resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With this
regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>'Tis a
consummation devoutly to be wished</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope
not thy ponderous and marble jaws</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go</span>
