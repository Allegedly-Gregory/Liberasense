<span class = 'sc05'>This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
side towards Illinois</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was cool in
there</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time</span>
