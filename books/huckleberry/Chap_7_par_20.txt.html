<p class='sc06'>
<span class = 'sc04'>I took the axe and smashed in the door</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I beat it and hacked it
considerable a-doing it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
and no boards</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
down it sunk, out of sight</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> You could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
touches</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
that</span>
