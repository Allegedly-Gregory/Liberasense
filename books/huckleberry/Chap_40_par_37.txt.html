<span class = 'sc05'>So here they come, full tilt</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We could hear them because they wore
boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We was
in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
them</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the
robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they
come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we
stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't
nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said
howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and
then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Then we
struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And when
we stepped on to the raft I says:</span>
