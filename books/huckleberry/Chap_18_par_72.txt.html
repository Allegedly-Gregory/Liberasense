<span class = 'sc04'>By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They started
riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
run</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after
them</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had
too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,
and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old</span>
