<span class = 'sc04'>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And
such another powwow as they made</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of
fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres</span>
