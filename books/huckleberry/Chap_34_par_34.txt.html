<span class = 'sc05'>Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was as long
as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The door to it was at
the south end, and was padlocked</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
so he took it and prized out one of the staples</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The chain fell down,
and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection
with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
the door was locked as good as ever</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Tom was joyful</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He says;</span>
