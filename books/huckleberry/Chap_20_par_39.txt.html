with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
to get the reward</span>

but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Too much
like jewelry</span>

as we say on the boards</span>
