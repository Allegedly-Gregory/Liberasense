<span class = 'sc05'>There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six
families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> They was as high-toned
and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The
Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was
about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a
lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their
fine horses</span>
