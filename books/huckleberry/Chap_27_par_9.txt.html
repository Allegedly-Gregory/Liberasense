<span class = 'sc06'>Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and
at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screw-driver</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I was in a sweat then, and watched him
pretty keen</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as
soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So there I was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
didn't know whether the money was in there or not</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So, says I, s'pose
somebody has hogged that bag on the sly</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--now how do I know whether
to write to Mary Jane or not</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>S'pose she dug him up and didn't find
nothing, what would she think of me</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Blame it, I says, I might get
hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it
a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch
the whole business</span>
