<span class = 'sc05'>The person coming was Mary Jane</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> She went to the coffin, very soft, and
kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see
she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I
slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them
watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything
was all right</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They hadn't stirred</span>
