<span class = 'sc05'> A
few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in
the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to
that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Don't anybody
live there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>says I</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>No, nobody, says they</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I didn't say any more, but
I done some thinking</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over
there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says
I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I hain't seen any
smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's
going over to see--him and another man</span>

got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago</span>
