<span class = 'sc07'>“I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a
friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
as he calls it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here
with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
foolish friends here, who ought to know better</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Mary Jane Wilks, you
know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Now listen
to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Will you</span>
