BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
boxes of seegars</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of
our lives</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The seegars was prime</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
time</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
he didn't want no more adventures</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He said that when I went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he
did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Well, he
was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
nigger</span>
