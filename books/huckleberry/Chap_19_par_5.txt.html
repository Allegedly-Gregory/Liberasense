<span class = 'sc05'>Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
It's lovely to live on a raft</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We had the sky up there, all speckled
with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim he
allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
have took too long to _make_ so many</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Jim said the moon could a _laid_
them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing
against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
could be done</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
streak down</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the
nest</span>
