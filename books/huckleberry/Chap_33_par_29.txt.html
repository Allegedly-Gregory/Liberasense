<span class = 'sc07'>Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
don't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for

<span class = 'sc05'> Tom was over the stile and starting for
the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
was all bunched in the front door</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Tom had his store clothes on, and an
audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> In them circumstances
it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,

lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them,
