<span class = 'sc07'>When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so
I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and
set it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and
disappointed, I didn't know why</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Â But at last, just as I was sailing by,
_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>and my heart swelled up
sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind
me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this
world</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand</span>
