 He'll hear Jim ain't from there</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Then his next move will be to
advertise Jim, or something like that</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So we can't resk being as long

<span class = 'sc05'> By rights I reckon we ought to be
a couple of years; but we can't</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Things being so uncertain, what I
recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
thirty-seven years</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the
first time there's an alarm</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way</span>
