<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc07'>We got away as soon as it was good and dark</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> The king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half
a mile out, all right</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> When we was three-quarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was my watch
below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,
because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not
by a long sight</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> My souls, how the wind did scream along</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And every
second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half
a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,
and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--bum</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
bum</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and
another sockdolager</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We didn't have no trouble
about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them</span>
