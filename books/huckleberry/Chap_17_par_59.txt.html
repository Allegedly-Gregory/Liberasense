<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc03'>They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,
and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the
Declaration</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
fifteen years old</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They was different from any pictures I ever see
before--blacker, mostly, than is common</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> One was a woman in a slim black
dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in
the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with
a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>”
  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight
to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a
chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath
the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>”
  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in
one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>”  These
was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take
to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
fan-tods</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot
more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done
what they had lost</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
having a better time in the graveyard</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> She was at work on what they
said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it
done, but she never got the chance</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> It was a picture of a young woman
in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump
off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with
the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up
towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died
before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the
head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung
flowers on it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Other times it was hid with a little curtain</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The young
woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so
many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me</span>
