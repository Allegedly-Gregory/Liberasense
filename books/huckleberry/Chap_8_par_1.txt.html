THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
o'clock</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I
could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
all about, and gloomy in there amongst them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was freckled places
on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
breeze up there</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
very friendly</span>
