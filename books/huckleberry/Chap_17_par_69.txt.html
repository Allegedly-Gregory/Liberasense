<span class = 'sc08'>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> There was a little
old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”
 and play “The Battle of Prague” on it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The walls of all the rooms was
plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside</span>
