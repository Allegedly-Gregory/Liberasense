<span class = 'sc07'>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
and fishing, and no books nor study</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Two months or more run along, and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever
got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on
a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
time</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I didn't want to go back no more</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I had stopped cussing, because
the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't
no objections</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
all around</span>
