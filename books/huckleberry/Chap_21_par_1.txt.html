IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> The
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good
deal</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,
and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs
dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went
to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> When he had got it pretty
good him and the duke begun to practice it together</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> The duke had to
learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn't bellow out _Romeo_</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
so--R-o-o-meo</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of
a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
