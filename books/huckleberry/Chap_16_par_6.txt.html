<span class = 'sc02'>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I
fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We neither of us could keep still</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 Every time he danced around and says, “Dah's Cairo</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>” it went through me
like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness</span>
