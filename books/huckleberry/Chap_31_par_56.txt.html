<span class = 'sc03'>So I left, and struck for the back country</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I didn't look around, but I
kinder felt like he was watching me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But I knowed I could tire him out
at that</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I
reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could
get away</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I didn't want no trouble with their kind</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I'd seen all I
wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them</span>
