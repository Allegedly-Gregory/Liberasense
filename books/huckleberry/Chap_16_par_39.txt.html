<span class = 'sc04'> We are right down sorry for
you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Look
here, I'll tell you what to do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Don't you try to land by yourself, or
you'll smash everything to pieces</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> You float along down about twenty
miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It
will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
your folks are all down with chills and fever</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Don't be a fool again,
and let people guess what is the matter</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Now we're trying to do you a
kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy</span>

 It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a
wood-yard</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's
in pretty hard luck</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
board, and you get it when it floats by</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I feel mighty mean to leave
you; but my kingdom</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see</span>
