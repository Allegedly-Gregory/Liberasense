<span class = 'sc06'> Why, that old man kep' up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come
out winner</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the
bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around
the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
 Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and
another died the next day</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards
he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz
they don't breed any of that _kind_</span>
