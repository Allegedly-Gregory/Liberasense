<span class = 'sc05'>That's all he said, and that's all I said</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> It warn't no use to say any
more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But I
couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
let it go, and never bothered no more about it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> If he was bound to have
it so, I couldn't help it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
