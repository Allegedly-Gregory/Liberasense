<span class = 'sc05'>Everybody was willing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> It swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he
had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
of the band</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that
mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
killed</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the
ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
and be forgot forever</span>
