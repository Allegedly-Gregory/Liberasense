<span class = 'sc07'>The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come
to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He had set
up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> And he
had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
they done it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash</span>

 He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of
his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set
up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty
square day's work for it</span>
