<span class = 'sc05'>So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so
mad</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start
to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they
come out right, and three times they come out wrong</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then she grabbed
up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if
we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin
us</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
with her shingle nail, before noon</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> We was very well satisfied with
this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike
again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if
she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the
next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody
that wanted her to ever count them any more</span>
