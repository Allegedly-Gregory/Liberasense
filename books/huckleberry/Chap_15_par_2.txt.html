<span class = 'sc06'>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything
but little saplings to tie to</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I passed the line around one of them
right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and
the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
away she went</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and
scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and
then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
and set her back a stroke</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But she didn't come</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I was in such a hurry
I hadn't untied her</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so
excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them</span>
