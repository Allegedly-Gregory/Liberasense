<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc07'>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> But I didn't do it
straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
and going to hell</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And went on thinking</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> And got to thinking over our
trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> But somehow I
couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
other kind</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's
got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper</span>
