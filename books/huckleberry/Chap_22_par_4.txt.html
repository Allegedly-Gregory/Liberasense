<span class = 'sc05'>Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> The
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked
sneaky</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant
kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread
that's got sand in it</span>
