<span class = 'sc07'>So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy
got the first jolt</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
mother down the river to Orleans</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> I thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each
other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The girls
said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold
away from the town</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of
them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks
and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had
to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no
account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two</span>
