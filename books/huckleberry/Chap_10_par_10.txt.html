<span class = 'sc06'>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into Illinois</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We split the ball open with the hatchet,
and there was a spool in it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to
coat it over so and make a ball of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the Mississippi, I reckon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Jim said he hadn't ever seen
a bigger one</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> He would a been worth a good deal over at the village</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes
a good fry</span>
