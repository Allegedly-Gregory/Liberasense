<span class = 'sc07'>“Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Nobody don't
have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction
on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till
they get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to
count, and they ain't going to get no money</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It's just like the way
it was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be
back before long</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Why, they can't collect the money for the _niggers_
yet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary</span>
