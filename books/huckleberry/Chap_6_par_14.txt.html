<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc02'>I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was pap looking wild, and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He said they was
crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He started
and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>take him
off</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>he's biting me on the neck</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  I never see a man look so wild in the
eyes</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
saying there was devils a-hold of him</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He wore out by and by, and laid
still a while, moaning</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
seemed terrible still</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He was laying over by the corner</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>By and by he
raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He says,
very low:</span>
