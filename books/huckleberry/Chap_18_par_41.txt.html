<span class = 'sc05'>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The
Shepherdsons done the same</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It was pretty ornery preaching--all about
brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was
a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such
a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet</span>
