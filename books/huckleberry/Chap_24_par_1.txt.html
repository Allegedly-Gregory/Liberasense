NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Jim
he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few
hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to
lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> You see, when we left him
all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway
nigger, you know</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it</span>
