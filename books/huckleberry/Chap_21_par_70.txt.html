<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
Sherburn</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with
the barrel tilted up towards the sky</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The same second I see a young
girl coming on the run, and two men with her</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Boggs and the men turned
round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men
jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to
a level--both barrels cocked</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,
“O Lord, don't shoot</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  Bang</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>goes the first shot, and he staggers back,
clawing at the air--bang</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards
on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> That young
girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”  The
crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting, “Back, back</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>give him air, give him air</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
