<span class = 'sc02'>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
these was vacant when I arrived</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This I hired</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
penury</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
door was off its hinges</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
benumbed by want and squalid poverty</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>As it was, I lived ungazed at
and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
of men</span>
