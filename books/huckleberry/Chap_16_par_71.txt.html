<span class = 'sc03'>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she
was close</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She aimed right for us</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Often they do that and try to see
how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
he's mighty smart</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to
try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> She
was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
over us</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went
overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
through the raft</span>
