<span class = 'sc05'>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
 I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left
shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
and crossed me off</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what
a mess you are always making</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>”  The widow put in a good word for me, but
that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one
of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
low-spirited and on the watch-out</span>
