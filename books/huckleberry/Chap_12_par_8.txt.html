<span class = 'sc04'>Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little
village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting
comfortable, and took him along</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I never see
pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway</span>
