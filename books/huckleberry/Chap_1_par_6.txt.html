<span class = 'sc04'>Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
the widow made her ease up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I couldn't stood it much longer</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Then for
an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Miss Watson would say,
“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up
like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would
say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to
behave</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
I was there</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> All I wanted
was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
 She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for
the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouldn't try for it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But I never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
