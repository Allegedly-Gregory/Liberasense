<span class = 'sc03'>So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was
before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
I hadn't done nothing</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But that's always the way; it don't make no
difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't
got no sense, and just goes for him anyway</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> If I had a yaller dog that
didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet
ain't no good, nohow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Tom Sawyer he says the same</span>
