<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc02'>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> The
ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
couldn't noway understand</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to
ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> They argued
and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show
come to a standstill</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that
stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>throw him
out</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” and one or two women begun to scream</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> So, then, the ringmaster
he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no
disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more
trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The minute
he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,
with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every
jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing
till tears rolled down</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> And at last, sure enough, all the circus men
could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,
round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging
to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,
and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> It
warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
 But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
dropped the bridle and stood</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>and the horse a-going like a house afire
too</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable
as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his
clothes and sling them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up
the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>And, then, there he
was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you
ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
astonishment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
