<span class = 'sc05'>Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I called it borrowing,
because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't
borrowing, it was stealing</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He said we was representing prisoners; and
prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
don't blame them for it, either</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and
so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when
he warn't a prisoner</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> So we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
was for</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
_needed_</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Well, I says, I needed the watermelon</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But he said I didn't
need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
 He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim
to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> So I let it go at
that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon</span>
