<span class = 'sc08'>Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to
do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
_him_</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done
with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down
in his presence till he asked them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>So Jim and me set to majestying him,
and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he
told us we might set down</span>

got cheerful and comfortable</span>

didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's
great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good
deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace
considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the
king says:</span>
