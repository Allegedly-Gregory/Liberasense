<span class = 'sc05'>The deck was high out here</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> We went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
dark we couldn't see no sign of them</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
through the texas-hall we see a light</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>and all in the same second we
seem to hear low voices in yonder</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
