<p class='sc02'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was an inch of new snow on the
ground, and I seen somebody's tracks</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden
fence</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
couldn't make it out</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was very curious, somehow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I was going to
follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I didn't
notice anything at first, but next I did</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> There was a cross in the left
boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil</span>
