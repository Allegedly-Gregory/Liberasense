<span class = 'sc03'>Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank
or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's
mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I whooped and listened</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Away down there somewheres I hears a small
whoop, and up comes my spirits</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went tearing after it, listening
sharp to hear it again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The next time it come I see I warn't heading
for it, but heading away to the right of it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> And the next time I was
heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for
I was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going
straight ahead all the time</span>
