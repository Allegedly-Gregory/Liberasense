<span class = 'sc07'>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She was right
about the rats</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> She showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't
know whether she could throw true now</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But she watched for a chance,
and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said
“Ouch</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” it hurt her arm so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then she told me to try for the next one</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course
I didn't let on</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his
nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a
tolerable sick rat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
would hive the next one</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She went and got the lump of lead and fetched
it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help
her with</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
went on talking about her and her husband's matters</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But she broke off
to say:</span>
