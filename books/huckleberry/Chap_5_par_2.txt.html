<p class='sc04'>
<span class = 'sc05'>He was most fifty, and he looked it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> His hair was long and tangled and
greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through
like he was behind vines</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
mixed-up whiskers</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> There warn't no color in his face, where his face
showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make
a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a
fish-belly white</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> As for his clothes--just rags, that was all</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He had
one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> His hat
was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like
a lid</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
