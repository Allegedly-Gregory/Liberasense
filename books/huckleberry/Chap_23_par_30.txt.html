<span class = 'sc05'>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He often
done that</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
didn't take notice nor let on</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I knowed what it was about</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He was
thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his
life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for their'n</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
was asleep, and saying, “Po' little 'Lizabeth</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>po' little Johnny</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>it's
mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>”  He
was a mighty good nigger, Jim was</span>
