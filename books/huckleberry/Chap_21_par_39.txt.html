<span class = 'sc05'>All the stores was along one street</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They had white domestic awnings in
front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting
on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and
chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery
lot</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,
but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
used considerable many cuss words</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was as many as one loafer
leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw
of tobacco or scratch</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> What a body was hearing amongst them all the
time was:</span>
