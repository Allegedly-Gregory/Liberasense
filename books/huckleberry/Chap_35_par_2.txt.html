And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan</span>

 There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
watchman</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And
there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
the chain</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Jim
could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be
no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Why, drat it,
Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>You got to invent _all_
the difficulties</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can

<span class = 'sc04'>Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more
honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was
their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your
own head</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Now look at just that one thing of the lantern</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> When you
come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's
resky</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,
I believe</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
make a saw out of the first chance we get</span>
