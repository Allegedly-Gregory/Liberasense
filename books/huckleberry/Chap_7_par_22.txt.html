<span class = 'sc05'>It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I
made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> I says to myself,
they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
drag the river for me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> And they'll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
that killed me and took the things</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> They won't ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They'll soon get tired of that, and won't
bother no more about me</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> All right; I can stop anywhere I want to</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
and nobody ever comes there</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> And then I can paddle over to town nights,
and slink around and pick up things I want</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Jackson's Island's the
place</span>
