<span class = 'sc07'>I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
when I heard a sound away over the water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I listened</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Pretty soon I
made it out</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I peeped out through
the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I couldn't tell how many was in it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> It kept a-coming, and when it was
abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Think's I, maybe
it's pap, though I warn't expecting him</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He dropped below me with the
current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
 Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars</span>
