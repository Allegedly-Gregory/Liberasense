<span class = 'sc05'>By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
see me and went for me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> He chased me round and round the place with a
clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
and then I couldn't come for him no more</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I begged, and told him I
was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
cussed, and kept on chasing me up</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Once when I turned short and
dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
as lightning, and saved myself</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
minute and then kill me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He put his knife under him, and said he would
sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who</span>
