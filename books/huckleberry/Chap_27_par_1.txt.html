I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I tiptoed
along, and got down stairs all right</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There warn't a sound anywheres</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that
was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> The door
was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a
candle in both rooms</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but
I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I
run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I
see to hide the bag was in the coffin</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> The lid was shoved along about
a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over
it, and his shroud on</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just
down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was
so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
