<span class = 'sc05'>“Yes</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled
to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
dying about the same time</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> The second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I am the lineal
descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and
here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised
by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft</span>
