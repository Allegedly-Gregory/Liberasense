<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc06'>Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
for me; I didn't want to see him no more</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was around</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, about this time
he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had
been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They said
he was floating on his back in the water</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They took him and buried him
on the bank</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think
of something</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on
his back, but on his face</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but
a woman dressed up in a man's clothes</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> So I was uncomfortable again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he
wouldn't</span>
