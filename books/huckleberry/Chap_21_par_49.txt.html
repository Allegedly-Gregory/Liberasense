<span class = 'sc07'>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,
and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The people
had moved out of them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The bank was caved away under one corner of some
others, and that corner was hanging over</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> People lived in them yet, but
it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it</span>
