<span class = 'sc05'>That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,
and the niggers waited on the rest</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Mary Jane she set at the head of
the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits
was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to
force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,
and said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” and
“Where, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” and
all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a
supper, you know</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
