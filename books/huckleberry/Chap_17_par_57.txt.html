<span class = 'sc07'>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,
made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> By one of the
parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;
and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open
their mouths nor look different nor interested</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They squeaked through
underneath</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out
behind those things</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> On the table in the middle of the room was a kind
of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and
grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where
pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it
was, underneath</span>
