<span class = 'sc05'>We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
warn't afraid of anybody running across us</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> We laid there all day,
and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I told Jim all
about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was
a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set
down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, then, I
said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long
as they didn't</span>
