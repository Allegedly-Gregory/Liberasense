<span class = 'sc05'>“You read about them once--you'll see</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n
's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And look at Charles Second,
and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> My,
you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He _was_ a
blossom</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
next morning</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They fetch her up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Next morning, 'Chop off her head</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And they chop it off</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>'Fetch up
Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her
head'--and they chop it off</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>'Ring up Fair Rosamun</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Fair Rosamun
answers the bell</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Next morning, 'Chop off her head</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> And he made every
one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had
hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a
book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the
case</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Well, Henry he
takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>How
does he go at it--give notice</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--give the country a show</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> All of a
sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks
out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> That was
_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He had suspicions of his
father, the Duke of Wellington</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, what did he do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Ask him to show
up</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> S'pose people
left money laying around where he was--what did he do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He collared it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set
down there and see that he done it--what did he do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> He always done the
other thing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>S'pose he opened his mouth--what then</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> If he didn't shut it
up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> That's the kind of a bug
Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled
that town a heap worse than ourn done</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I don't say that ourn is lambs,
because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they
ain't nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> All I say is, kings is kings,
and you got to make allowances</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Take them all around, they're a mighty
ornery lot</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It's the way they're raised</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
