WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave awhile if I could</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
and prayed, but nothing come of it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She told me to pray every day, and
whatever I asked for I would get it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But it warn't so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I tried it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> It warn't any good to me without
hooks</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn't make it work</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to
try for me, but she said I was a fool</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> She never told me why, and I
couldn't make it out no way</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
