<span class = 'sc07'>Pray for me</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more
nearer her size</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that
kind</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there
warn't no back-down to her, I judge</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> You may say what you want to, but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
my opinion she was just full of sand</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It sounds like flattery, but it
ain't no flattery</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she
lays over them all</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see
her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon
I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good
for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust</span>
