<span class = 'sc04'>As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> And next time Jim told
it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
was all over saddle-boils</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Niggers would come
miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
nigger in that country</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Strange niggers would stand with their mouths
open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Niggers is
always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
Jim would happen in and say, “Hm</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> What you know 'bout witches</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>” and
that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Jim always kept
that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
 Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they
had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch
it, because the devil had had his hands on it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Jim was most ruined for
a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
and been rode by witches</span>
