<p class='sc08'>
<span class = 'sc05'>So we stayed where we was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> The duke he fretted and sweated around, and
was in a mighty sour way</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't
seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Something was a-brewing, sure</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I was good and glad when midday come
and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_
change on top of it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So me and the duke went up to the village, and
hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to
them</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and
shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a
long day before they ever see me and Jim again</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I got down there all
out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:</span>
