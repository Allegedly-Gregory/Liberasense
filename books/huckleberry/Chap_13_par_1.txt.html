WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Shut up on a wreck with
such a gang as that</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But it warn't no time to be sentimentering</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> We'd
_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So we went
a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
too--seemed a week before we got to the stern</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> No sign of a boat</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Jim
said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't
hardly any strength left, he said</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> But I said, come on, if we get left
on this wreck we are in a fix, sure</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So on we prowled again</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> We struck
for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
edge of the skylight was in the water</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> When we got pretty close to the
cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I could just barely
see her</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I felt ever so thankful</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> In another second I would a been
aboard of her, but just then the door opened</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> One of the men stuck his
head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;
but he jerked it in again, and says:</span>
