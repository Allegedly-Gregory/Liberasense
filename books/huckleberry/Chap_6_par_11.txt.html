<span class = 'sc05'> Why, looky here</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as
a white man</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And
what do you think</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could
talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And that ain't the
wust</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They said he could _vote_ when he was at home</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Well, that let me
out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> It was 'lection day,
and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get
there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I says I'll never vote agin</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
 Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
rot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> And to see the
cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't
shoved him out o' the way</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I says to the people, why ain't this nigger
put up at auction and sold</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>--that's what I want to know</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And what do you
reckon they said</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in
the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> There,
now--that's a specimen</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> They call that a govment that can't sell a free
nigger till he's been in the State six months</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> Here's a govment that
calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before
it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
nigger, and--”</span>
