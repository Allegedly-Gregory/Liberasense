<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc05'>I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out
for what the rise might fetch along</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Well, all at once here comes a
canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
high like a duck</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> I just expected
there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd
raise up and laugh at him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> But it warn't so this time</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> It was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Thinks
I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
 But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running
her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then,
'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river
about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot</span>
