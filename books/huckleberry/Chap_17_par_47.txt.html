<span class = 'sc06'>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they
had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've
come across yet</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> They
all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> The young women had
quilts around them, and their hair down their backs</span>
<span class = 'sc01'> They all asked me
questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went
to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and
started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
I come to be here</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> So they said I could have a home there as long as I
wanted it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
I had forgot what my name was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>So I laid there about an hour trying to
think, and when Buck waked up I says:</span>
