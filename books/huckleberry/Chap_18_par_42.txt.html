<span class = 'sc06'>About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Buck and
a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I went up
to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> I found that sweet
Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took
me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,
and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
not tell anybody, and I said I would</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Then she said she'd forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
nothing to nobody</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> I said I would</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>So I slid out and slipped off up the
road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
in summer-time because it's cool</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> If you notice, most folks don't go to
church only when they've got to; but a hog is different</span>
