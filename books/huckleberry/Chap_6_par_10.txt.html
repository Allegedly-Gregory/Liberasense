<span class = 'sc05'>“Call this a govment</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>why, just look at it and see what it's like</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--a
man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety
and all the expense of raising</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> Yes, just as that man has got that
son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for
_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> And they call
_that_ govment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That ain't all, nuther</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> The law backs that old Judge
Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> Here's what
the law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They call that
govment</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> A man can't get his rights in a govment like this</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Sometimes
I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Yes,
and I _told_ 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Lots of 'em
heard me, and can tell what I said</span>
<span class = 'sc03'> Says I, for two cents I'd leave the
blamed country and never come a-near it agin</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Them's the very words</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> I
says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the
rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly
a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o'
stove-pipe</span>
<span class = 'sc07'> Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the
wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights</span>
