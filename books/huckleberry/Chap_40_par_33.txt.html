<p class='sc04'>
<span class = 'sc05'>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on
us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed</span>
<span class = 'sc06'> But we got under all
right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,
and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> Now we was in the
lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So we crept to the door,
and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make
out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
first, and him last</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
and started somebody sings out:</span>
