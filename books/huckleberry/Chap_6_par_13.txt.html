<span class = 'sc05'>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
for two drunks and one delirium tremens</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> That was always his word</span>
<span class = 'sc02'> I
judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other</span>
<span class = 'sc08'> He drank and drank, and
tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
 He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy</span>
<span class = 'sc04'> He groaned and moaned and
thrashed around this way and that for a long time</span>
<span class = 'sc05'> At last I got so
sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning</span>
