<span class = 'sc08'>It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips</span>

a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
watches), poured the chocolate out</span>

dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring Heavens</span>

his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men; he must have died of two</span>
