<span class = 'sc05'>When Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
the beach</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
ostrich</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
destruction</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
brought the coast down, madly</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A little
fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
made, and was near flood</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter</span>
