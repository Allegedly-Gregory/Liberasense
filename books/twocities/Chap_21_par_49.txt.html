<span class = 'sc05'>On this second day, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>This encouraged Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Lorry's
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him</span>
