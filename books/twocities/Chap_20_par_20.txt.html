<span class = 'sc05'>“See</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
“I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
light</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” He added in his inward and pondering
manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember,
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
