<span class = 'sc02'>“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Weep
for her, then, and for me</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Good gentlemen, thank God</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I feel his sacred
tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>O, see</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Thank
God for us, thank God</span>
