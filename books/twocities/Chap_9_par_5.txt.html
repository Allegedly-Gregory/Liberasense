<span class = 'sc08'>Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
ally</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
might have floated a king's ship</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>At last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity</span>
