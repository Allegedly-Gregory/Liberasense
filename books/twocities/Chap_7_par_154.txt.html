her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him</span>

shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done</span>

felt it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>That was the manner of our beginning to speak together</span>
