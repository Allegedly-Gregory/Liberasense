<span class = 'sc05'>Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
water</span>
