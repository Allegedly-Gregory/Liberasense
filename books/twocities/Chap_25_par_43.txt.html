<span class = 'sc05'>The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>In the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>With the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire</span>
