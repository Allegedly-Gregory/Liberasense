<span class = 'sc05'>That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Then, among the
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They came, and
the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her</span>
