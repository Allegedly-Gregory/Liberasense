<span class = 'sc04'>For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Although Miss Pross, through her long
association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was
pleased to call it) than Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher did</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>So her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>She always
made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be</span>
