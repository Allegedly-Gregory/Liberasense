<span class = 'sc02'>But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
The Vengeance</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>There was no other music
than their own singing</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>At first, they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time</span>
