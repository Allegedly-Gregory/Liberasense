<span class = 'sc04'>Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
out</span>
