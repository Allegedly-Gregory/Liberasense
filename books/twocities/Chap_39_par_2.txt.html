<span class = 'sc03'>Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Six
tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>And yet there is not in
France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Crush
humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind</span>
