<span class = 'sc05'>Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
his wake, like a boat towed astern</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads</span>
