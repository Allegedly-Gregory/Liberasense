<span class = 'sc05'>â€œEarly in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
circumstances</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>I had kept the matter a
profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
in my letter</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed</span>
