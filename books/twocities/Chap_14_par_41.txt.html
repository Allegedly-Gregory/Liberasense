<span class = 'sc08'>“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
