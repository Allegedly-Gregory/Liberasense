<span class = 'sc03'>It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Lorry</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>She had installed herself, some
time before, as Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads</span>
