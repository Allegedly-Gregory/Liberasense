<span class = 'sc02'>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>It was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>So expressive
it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die</span>
