<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc06'>More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
language who was conversant with French literature</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In this age, he
would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>As a
tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Darnay soon became
known and encouraged</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered</span>
