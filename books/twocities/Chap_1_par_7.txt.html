<span class = 'sc08'>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five</span>

and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them</span>
