<span class = 'sc05'>It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter's Hill</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to Blackheath</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty</span>
