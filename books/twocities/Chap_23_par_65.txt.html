<span class = 'sc04'>There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There were
the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them</span>
