<span class = 'sc05'>“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself</span>

Heaven is my witness that I love her</span>
