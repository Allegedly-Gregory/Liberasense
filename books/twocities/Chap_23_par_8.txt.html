<span class = 'sc05'>The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
done often</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He never came there heated with wine</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>And one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages</span>
