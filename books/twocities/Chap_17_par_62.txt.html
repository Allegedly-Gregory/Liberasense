it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable

<span class = 'sc07'>He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him

<span class = 'sc02'>It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>And even then
it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep</span>
