bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
“I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I knew it from himself</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He
knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
when he made shoes under my care</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
when the place shall fall, to examine that cell</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It falls</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I mount to
the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I examine it, very closely</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In a hole in the chimney, where a
stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This is
that written paper</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of Doctor Manette</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>This is the writing of Doctor Manette</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President</span>
