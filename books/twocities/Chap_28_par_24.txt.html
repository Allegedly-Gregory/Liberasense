<span class = 'sc08'>“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>I have been
a Bastille prisoner</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>--What is that noise</span>
