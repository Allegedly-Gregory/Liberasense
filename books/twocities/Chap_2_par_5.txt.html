<span class = 'sc05'>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears, and wore jack-boots</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Not one of the three could have said, from
anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
the eyes of the body, of his two companions</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In those days, travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>As to the latter,
when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
“the Captain's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>So the guard
of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass</span>
