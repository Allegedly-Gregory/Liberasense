<span class = 'sc07'>A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
over the counter</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Yet such things were</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Tellson's had whitewashed the
Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
night</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
provocation</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his money</span>
