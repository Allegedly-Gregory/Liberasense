<span class = 'sc03'>Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The drum's was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine's bosom</span>
