yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
is, but even if it wos</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>There'd be two sides
to it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his
fardens--fardens</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>no, nor
yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah</span>

ruinating</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
it</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,

with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get

<span class = 'sc04'>He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
