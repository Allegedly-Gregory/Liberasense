<span class = 'sc05'>There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it</span>
