<span class = 'sc05'>Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors</span>
