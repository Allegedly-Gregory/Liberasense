<span class = 'sc07'>On this certain fine Sunday, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
the afternoon, for three reasons of habit</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them</span>
