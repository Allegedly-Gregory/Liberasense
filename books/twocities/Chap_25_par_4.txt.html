<span class = 'sc08'>Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>There must
be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable</span>
