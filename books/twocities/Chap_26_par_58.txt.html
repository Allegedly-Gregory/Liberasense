<span class = 'sc02'>â€œThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>It is in vain I represent that,
before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process</span>

an emigrant, and where is that emigrant</span>
