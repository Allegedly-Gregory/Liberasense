<span class = 'sc04'>It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>It
attracted Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>His indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Lorry;
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot</span>
