<span class = 'sc05'>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
door stood ajar all night</span>
