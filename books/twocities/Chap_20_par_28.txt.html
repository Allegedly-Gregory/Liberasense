<span class = 'sc05'>“So</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I have seen her
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of</span>
