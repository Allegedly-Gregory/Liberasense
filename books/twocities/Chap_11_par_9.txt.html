<span class = 'sc05'>The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon Monseigneur</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>As a promising way of setting
them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
Future, for Monseigneur's guidance</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the
Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
by fasting and seeing of spirits</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
became manifest</span>
