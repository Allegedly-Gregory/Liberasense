<span class = 'sc05'>“Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
That's a very good card</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
English government, the enemy of France and freedom</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>That's an excellent
card</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>That's a card not to be beaten</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Have you followed my
hand, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Barsad</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
