<span class = 'sc02'>In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>These she put on,
out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry, and then got up and hurried away</span>
