<span class = 'sc04'>Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree</span>

dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very

his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that

contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out</span>
