<span class = 'sc05'>Six tumbrils roll along the streets</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants</span>

No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the Creator, never reverses his transformations</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>“If thou be changed
into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in
the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But, if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>”
 Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along</span>
