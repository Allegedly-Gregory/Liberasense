<span class = 'sc08'>At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
dimmed</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much</span>

Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her breast</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
eyes, and broke like waves</span>
