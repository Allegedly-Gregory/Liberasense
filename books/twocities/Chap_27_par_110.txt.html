<span class = 'sc05'>“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“He made shoes, he made
shoes, he made shoes</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition</span>

“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>There was one among
them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>* * * * He
made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>* * * * Five paces by four and
a half</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
knew, in the swell that rose above them</span>
