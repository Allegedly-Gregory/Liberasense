<span class = 'sc03'>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply-curling short dark hair</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man</span>
