<span class = 'sc03'>What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not
much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
peck at, on a heap of stones</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds</span>

no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
fountain</span>
