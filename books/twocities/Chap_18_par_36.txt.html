<span class = 'sc03'>“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Also, I see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Ah, but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot</span>
