<span class = 'sc02'>A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>As its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life</span>
