<span class = 'sc03'>On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>On this occasion,

to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too</span>
