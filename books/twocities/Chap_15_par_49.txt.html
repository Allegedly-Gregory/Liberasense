<span class = 'sc07'>Thank you</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Well, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>You
know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What do you say</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
