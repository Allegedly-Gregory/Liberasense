<span class = 'sc05'>“Well</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>So I have made up my mind</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in a bad way</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>You don't know the value of money,
you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
