<span class = 'sc05'>These three young gentlemen, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie's husband: delicately saying “Halloa</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>” The polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>
Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
Mrs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not
to be caught</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>” Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way</span>
