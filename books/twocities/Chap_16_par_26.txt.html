<span class = 'sc03'>No, Miss Manette, to none</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it</span>
