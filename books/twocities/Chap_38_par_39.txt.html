<span class = 'sc05'>Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Carelessly

dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets</span>
