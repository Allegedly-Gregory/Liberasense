<span class = 'sc05'>Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe</span>
