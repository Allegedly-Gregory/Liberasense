<span class = 'sc05'>He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own</span>
