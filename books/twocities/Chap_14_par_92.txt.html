<span class = 'sc08'>Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Stryver's papers before the setting in
of the long vacation</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again</span>
