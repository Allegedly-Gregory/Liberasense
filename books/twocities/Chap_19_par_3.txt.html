<span class = 'sc05'>Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it</span>
