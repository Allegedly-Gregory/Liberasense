<span class = 'sc05'>Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Some, to the
fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot</span>
