<span class = 'sc05'>Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
sign of the house</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He was never absent during business hours, unless
upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
of twelve, who was his express image</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>People understood that Tellson's,
in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry</span>
