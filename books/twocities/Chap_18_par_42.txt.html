<span class = 'sc02'>“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
