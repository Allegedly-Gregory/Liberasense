<span class = 'sc04'>“They ain't worth
much, then</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I can't
afford it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>If
you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
child, and not in opposition to 'em</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If I had had any but a unnat'ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck</span>

laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
say now</span>
