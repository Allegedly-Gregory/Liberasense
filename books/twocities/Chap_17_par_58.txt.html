<span class = 'sc04'>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>In the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
