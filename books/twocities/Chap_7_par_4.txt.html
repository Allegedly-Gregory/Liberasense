<span class = 'sc08'>Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>If your business necessitated your seeing
“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking-house air</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Your lighter boxes of family
papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
Abyssinia or Ashantee</span>
