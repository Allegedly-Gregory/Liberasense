<span class = 'sc05'>The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>His condition was that of a young gentleman</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He was plainly
dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
of his way than for ornament</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>As an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet</span>
