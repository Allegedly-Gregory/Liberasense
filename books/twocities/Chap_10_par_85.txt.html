<span class = 'sc04'>“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
had been, for many years, built up and forgotten</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
execution, had cut as his last work, three letters</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They were done with
some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>
At first, they were read as D</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>C</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>There was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>At length, it was suggested
that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
