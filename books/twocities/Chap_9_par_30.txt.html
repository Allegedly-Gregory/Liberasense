<span class = 'sc05'>At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
proceeded to offer it to him</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning</span>
