<span class = 'sc04'>Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
trees</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
either side</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
anything but stopping</span>
