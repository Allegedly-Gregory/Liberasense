<span class = 'sc05'>Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>“At
Tellson's banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>“Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself</span>

precaution, and may be a necessary preparation</span>
