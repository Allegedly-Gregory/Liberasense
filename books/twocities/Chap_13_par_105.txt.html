<span class = 'sc05'>For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads</span>

The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed</span>
