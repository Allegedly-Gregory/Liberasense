<span class = 'sc05'>The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>There was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Neither did the
people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
remained so</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
and tame in its extreme submission</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes</span>
