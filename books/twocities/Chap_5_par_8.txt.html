<p class='sc01'>
<span class = 'sc05'>Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
inflicting</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
were, all, grim illustrations of Want</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The butcher and the porkman
painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
meagre loaves</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
gloweringly confidential together</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
gunmaker's stock was murderous</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>The crippling stones of the pavement,
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
broke off abruptly at the doors</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The kennel, to make amends, ran down
the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Across
the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead, as if they were at sea</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Indeed they were at sea, and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest</span>
<span class = 'sc05'></span>
