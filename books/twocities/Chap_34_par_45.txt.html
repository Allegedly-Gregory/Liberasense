<span class = 'sc07'>â€œOn some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point</span>
