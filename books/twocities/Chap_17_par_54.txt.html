<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one

took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature</span>

in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out</span>
