<span class = 'sc04'>“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He married--an English lady--and
I was one of the trustees</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>These are mere business relations, miss;
there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
sentiment</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
machine</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>To go on--”</span>
