<span class = 'sc07'>“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you</span>
