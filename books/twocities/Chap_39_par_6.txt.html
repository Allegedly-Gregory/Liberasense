<p class='sc07'>
<span class = 'sc05'>There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
question</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
girl</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Here and there in the long street of St</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Honore, cries are raised
against him</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>He cannot easily
touch his face, his arms being bound</span>
