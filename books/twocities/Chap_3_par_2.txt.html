<p class='sc04'>
<span class = 'sc07'>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>A
solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Something of the
awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>No more can I
turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
to read it all</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
but a page</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
in ignorance on the shore</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In
any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them</span>
