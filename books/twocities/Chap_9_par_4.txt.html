<span class = 'sc05'>It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>
But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this</span>

business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning</span>
