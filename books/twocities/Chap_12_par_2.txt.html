<span class = 'sc07'>A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
disposition to give up, and wither away</span>
