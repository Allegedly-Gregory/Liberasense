<span class = 'sc05'>Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>All adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them</span>
