<span class = 'sc08'>As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Again: Tellson's was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
a matter of course</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read</span>
