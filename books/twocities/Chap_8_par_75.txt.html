<span class = 'sc07'>“Do you particularly like the man</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>” he muttered, at his own image; “why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>There is nothing
in you to like; you know that</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Ah, confound you</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>What a change you have

<span class = 'sc06'>A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Change

he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Come on, and
have it out in plain words</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>You hate the fellow</span>
