<span class = 'sc04'>Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
his own hands</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man</span>
