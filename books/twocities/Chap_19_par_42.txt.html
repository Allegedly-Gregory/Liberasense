<span class = 'sc07'>Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air</span>

and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Curious to consider how heedless flies are</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day</span>
