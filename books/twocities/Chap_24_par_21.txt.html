<span class = 'sc05'>The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>
Villain Foulon taken, my sister</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Old Foulon taken, my mother</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>O mother of God, this Foulon</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>O Heaven our
suffering</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
him</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot</span>
