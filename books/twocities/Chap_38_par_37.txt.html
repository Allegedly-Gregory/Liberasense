<span class = 'sc02'>There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Of a
strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
heaved her up, under any circumstances</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>But, imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
opportunity had developed her into a tigress</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>She was absolutely without
pity</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
her</span>
