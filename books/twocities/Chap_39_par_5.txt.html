<span class = 'sc07'>Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together</span>
<span class = 'sc01'>Only one, and
he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people</span>
