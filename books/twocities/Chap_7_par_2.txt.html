<span class = 'sc05'>Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>They were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>This was
no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Tellson's (they said) wanted
no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
embellishment</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Noakes and Co</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
Tellson's, thank Heaven--</span>
