at him by stealth, for it is afraid</span>

of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
faces are turned towards the prison</span>

<span class = 'sc01'>They
whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself</span>
