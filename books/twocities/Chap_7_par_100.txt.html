<p class='sc05'>
<span class = 'sc08'>The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
great rate</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>He began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>In arranging
his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner's pockets, over and over again</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner's desk</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He had not put them there first</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>He
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
information</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He didn't call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him</span>
