<span class = 'sc05'>With his straw in his mouth, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health</span>
<span class = 'sc08'>And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed</span>
