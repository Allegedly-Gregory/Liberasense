<span class = 'sc05'>There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>When the gaoler was
gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were
dead</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>”</span>
