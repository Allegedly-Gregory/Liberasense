<span class = 'sc02'>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile

<span class = 'sc06'>Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
