<span class = 'sc05'>On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying a light</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>The
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime</span>
