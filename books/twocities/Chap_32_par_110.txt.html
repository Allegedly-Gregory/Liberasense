Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side</span>
<span class = 'sc06'>They
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>It
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
Republic</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it</span>
<span class = 'sc07'>Better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him close</span>
