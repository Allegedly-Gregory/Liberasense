<span class = 'sc06'>Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>My Lord inquired of Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>Stryver (the prisoner's
counsel), whether they were next to try Mr</span>
<span class = 'sc03'>Carton (name of my learned
friend) for treason</span>

would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
confident, having seen it; and more</span>

this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber</span>
