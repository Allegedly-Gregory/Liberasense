<span class = 'sc02'>â€œI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767</span>
<span class = 'sc02'>I write
it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty</span>
<span class = 'sc05'>I design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it</span>
<span class = 'sc04'>Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
and my sorrows are dust</span>
